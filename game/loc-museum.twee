Winter stands polishing a brass pot. <<He>> regards you with a level stare. "Don't touch anything," <<he>> says. "I doubt you've washed your hands."<br><br>

"What insolence," <<he>> sneers. "I suppose I should expect no better. Don't think I won't ban you from the premises."

<<He>> places the pot back on its pedestal. "It's a sorry collection for an area so rich in history. The mayor's office agrees, and has set aside funds to reward anyone who provides local antiques."<br><br>

<<He>> starts polishing an ornate breastplate. "If you find anything, I'll appraise it. I won't hold my breath."<br><br>
