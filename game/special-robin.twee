You said you were fine with it earlier, but ever since you paid off those cops with your body you have been winding tighter and tighter.

You've been through a lot. You know none of this is Robin's fault exactly, but you go after <<him>> anyway and chew <<him>> out about every little thing you can think of. <<He>> tears up, but doesn't complain.
