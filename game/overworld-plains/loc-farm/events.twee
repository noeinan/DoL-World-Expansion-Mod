You prowl the yard until you catch the scent of the rogue bird on the breeze. You look up, and see it perched on the roof of the farmhouse.

You almost grasp the chicken with your mouth, but catch yourself and lift it with your arms instead. You drop down to the porch, and then the yard, before returning to the coop.
