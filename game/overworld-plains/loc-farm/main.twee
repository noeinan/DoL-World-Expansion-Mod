You cover your eyes and hold out the towel. Alex pulls it from your grasp.
<br><br>

You turn to the window. You hear Alex continue to rummage in the basket, then walk back through the kitchen. You hear <<him>> climb the staircase.

	"B-But you're so hot," you say, keeping the towel.
<<elseif $submissive lte 850>>
	"I prefer you like this," you say, keeping the towel.
<<else>>
	"You look pretty good," you say, keeping the towel.

<br><br>
Alex throws an anxious glance out the window, then turns back to the basket. <<He>> rummages with one hand, using the other to cover <<his>> ass.
<br><br>

<<He>> holds the clothes in front of <<his>> body as <<he>> leaves the kitchen and climbs the stairs.

A car pulls into the yard some minutes later, just as Alex arrives at the bottom of the stairs. "That's <<him>>," <<he>> says. "I hope I look okay."
<br><br>

You leave the farmhouse with Alex. Up ahead, climbing from a car, is an older, thicker version of Alex.
<br><br>

"<<if $pronoun is "m">>Hi dad<<else>>Hi mum<</if>>," Alex says.
<br><br>
They face each other for an awkward moment, then the <<if $pronoun is "m">>father<<else>>mother<</if>> steps forward, and grasps Alex by the shoulders.<<lcontrol>><<control -10>>

They pull away from each other. "Knew you had it in ya," the <<if $pronoun is "m">>father<<else>>mother<</if>> says. <<He>> looks at you over <<his>> <<if $pronoun is "m">>son's<<else>>daughter's<</if>> shoulder. "You must be the townie. Alex's told me all about you."
<br><br>

Alex turns. "That's right," <<he>> says, resting a hand on your shoulder. "<<pShes>> great with the animals."
<br>
<<His>> <<if $pronoun is "m">>father<<else>>mother<</if>> nods. "A farm this size with only two people? Impressive. You need to show me around. First though-"
<br>
Alex is already walking towards the farmhouse. <<He>> stops at the door. "Tea of coffee?"
<br>
"You know the answer to that."

You sit at the kitchen table with Alex's <<if $pronoun is "m">>father<<else>>mother<</if>>. "Surprised a townie can be so helpful-"
<br>
"<<if $pronoun is "m">>Dad<<else>>Mum<</if>>-" Alex interrupts.
<br>
"More surprised by how cute you are-"
<br>
"<<if $pronoun is "m">>Dad!<<else>>Mum!<</if>>" Alex says again, slamming a mug of tea in front of the older <<if $pronoun is "m">>man<<else>>woman<</if>>."
<br>
"Sorry," <<he>> chuckles. "Thanks for the tea."

Alex takes <<his>> <<if $pronoun is "m">>father<<else>>mother<</if>> on a tour of the farm, and insists you come along. The older <<if $pronoun is "m">>man<<else>>woman<</if>> stops to examine each animal, and seems pleased with what <<he>> sees.
<br><br>
Alex beams with pride when you reach the fields. The first three are filled with rows of green potato plants. The last is barren, but clear and ready for planting.
<br><br>

You return to the farmhouse. "You've done a good job," Alex's <<if $pronoun is "m">>father<<else>>mother<</if>> says. "Keep it up. Sorry I can't get out here more often. You know how it is." <<He>> reaches into <<his>> pocket. "Left my keys in the kitchen. Could you grab them?"
<br><br>
Alex enters the farmhouse.

Now alone, the older <<if $pronoun is "m">>man<<else>>woman<</if>> turns to you. "This is for you," <<he>> says pulling an envelope from <<his>> pocket. <<He>> holds it out.
<br><br>

"Open it when I'm gone," <<he>> continues. "And don't tell Alex."
<br><br>

Alex emerges from the farmhouse, and holds out the keys. "Thanks," <<his>> <<if $pronoun is "m">>father<<else>>mother<</if>> says. "I'll give the others your love." <<He>> climbs into the car, and drives away.

Alex watches until the car vanishes from view. "I'm glad you were here to meet <<him>>," <<he>> says, turning back to the farm. "Come on. There's work to do."
<br><br>

You nod, but hang back until Alex disappears behind the sty. You open the envelope. There's a wad of cash inside, along with a note.
<br><br>

<i>"Thanks for looking out for my <<if $pronoun is "m">>son<<else>>daughter<</if>>. Here's a little something for you. Don't give it to Alex. And don't let <<him>> pressure you into anything. <<Hes>> a good <<if $pronoun is "m">>boy<<else>>girl<</if>>, but dogged."

<br><br>
You count the money. There's <span class="gold">£10000</span>.
<<set $money += 1000000>>
