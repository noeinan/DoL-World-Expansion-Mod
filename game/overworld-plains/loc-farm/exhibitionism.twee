You launch into a sprint, running down the road behind the tractor. Your heart skips a beat as the driver honks the horn.

The tractor rumbles into motion once more. Careful, you climb down to the trailer proper. The vehicle isn't moving fast, but if you left now the driver might spot you. Unless you were quick.

:: Farm Builders Exposed Cottage
<<effects>>

You sprint to the cottage, your heart pounding in your chest. The voices draw closer, but you make it before being seen. You grasp the door handle with shaking hands,

	"It is," replies another voice. "<<pShe>> must be some kinda pervert, going outside like that."
	<br><br>
	<<fameexhibitionism 2>>
	Face red, you turn and run around the side of the cottage.
	<br><br>

	You hide at the back, shielded from view by a thick hedge. No one follows you.

:: Farm Builders Exposed Cottage Hide
<<effects>>

You dash around the side of the cottage. You make it in time, and crouch, shielded from view by the cottage on one side, and a thick hedge on the other.
<br><br>

You can't enter the cottage from here. Not without smashing a window, and making a lot of noise. You wait for the voices in the yard to fade before emerging from your hiding place.

:: Farm Builders Exposed Shed

You turn and sprint back to the shed, your heart pounding in your chest.

	<br><br>

	<br>
	"It is," responds another voice. "What's <<pshe>> doing dressed like that, and on all-fours? <<pShe>> some kind of pervert?"
	<br><br>

	You make it around the corner of the shed. They don't follow, at least.

:: Farm Builders Exposed Road
<<effects>>

You turn away from the voices, and run towards the road, your heart pounding in your chest. You glance over your shoulder. You can see the cottage, but not the yard itself. You don't think they saw you.
<br><br>

You don't want to run onto the road, so you crouch at the edge of the farm, and wait for the voices to pass.

	However, <span class="pink">they instead draw closer.</span> They must be leaving the farm.
	<br><br>
	You peek out at the road. There's no one around. You dread the thought of heading out there in your state, but it's the only way to avoid being seen, and it won't be for long. You run around the corner without a moment to spare.<<gstress>><<stress 6>>
