It's dark, with only a little natural light entering through a small window. You can make out a decaying cabinet. Perhaps there are clothes inside.

You open the doors, and cough at the scatter of dust. Something heavy thuds to the ground. As the dust clears you make out a metallic glint. It's a grenade.

You almost panic, but the pin is still in. It also looks old. So old that it can't still be live, surely. A collector would be interested in this.
