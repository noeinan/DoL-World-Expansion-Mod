<<widget "livestock_overhear">>
<<generate1>><<generate2>><<person1>>
You overhear two farmhands talking behind the fence.
<<cleareventpool>>
<<addinlineevent "livestock_overhear 1">>
	"How does Remy keep that herd of beasts under control?" a <<person>> asks.
	<br>
	"No clue," a <<person2>><<person>> responds. "They won't respond to anyone else."
	<br>
	"Have you seen them at full gallop?"
	<br>
	"Aye. Cow got free once, and Remy chased it down on one. Was terrifying to see."
	<br><br>
	They walk out of earshot.
	<br><br>
<</addinlineevent>>

<<addinlineevent "livestock_overhear 2">>
	"Remy's a stingy bastard," a <<person>> says, looking over <<his>> shoulder.
	<br>
	"Aye," a <<person2>><<person>> responds. "Especially with the animals. Treats apples like they're fucking gold."
	<br>
	"I ate an apple in front of those horses once. The way they looked at it, I almost felt bad."
	<br><br>
	They walk out of earshot.
	<br><br>
<</addinlineevent>>

<<addinlineevent "livestock_overhear 3">>
	"Where'd you think the milk ends up?" a <<person>> asks.
	<br>
	"Where'd you think?" a <<person2>><<person>> responds. "In a supermarket. Where else?"
	<br>
	"No, I mean the," <<person1>><<he>> looks over <<his>> shoulder. "The milk from the special cattle. I'm not drinking it with my tea am I?"
	<br>
	"I know some gets processed elsewhere. Don't know more than that."
	<br><br>
	They walk out of earshot.
	<br><br>
<</addinlineevent>>

<<addinlineevent "livestock_overhear 4">>
	"Heard more strange noises last night," a <<person>> says. "From the south."
	<br>
	"Just some animal," a <<person2>><<person>> responds. "A wolf, at worst. What, you scared?"
	<br>
	"You haven't heard it. I'm telling you. Like a screech. I'm asking Remy to change my hours."
	<br><br>
	They walk out of earshot.
	<br><br>
<</addinlineevent>>

<<addinlineevent "livestock_overhear 5">>
	"There's no way," a <<person>> says. "One of the teachers would step in."
	<br>
	"They don't though," a <<person2>><<person>> responds. "Maybe they don't know. Check it out yourself if you don't believe me."
	<br>
	"You know I don't like that part of town. Smells like shit."
	<br>
	"Doesn't smell like any shit I've known."
	<br><br>
	They walk out of earshot.
	<br><br>
<</addinlineevent>>

<<addinlineevent "livestock_overhear 6">>
	"That doctor makes me uncomfortable," a <<person>> says.
	<br>
	"The kid?" a <<person2>><<person>> laughs. "Don't be daft."
	<br>
	"<<nnpc_Hes "Harper">> too nice for a place like this. Something's not right."
	<br>
	"I think you're just afraid of doctors."
	<br><br>
	They walk out of earshot.
	<br><br>
<</addinlineevent>>

<<addinlineevent "livestock_overhear 7">>
	"Where'd they get new <<girls>> anyway?" a <<person>> asks. "Just grab em off the street?"
	<br>
	"Remy knows a few sellers," a <<person2>><<person>> responds. "Dunno how they get them. Police sometimes throw trash our way."
	<br>
	"Explains the squad car. Thought they were just shaking us down."
	<br>
	"They probably were."
	<br><br>
	They walk out of earshot.
	<br><br>
<</addinlineevent>>

<<addinlineevent "livestock_overhear 8">>
	"That new <<girl>> is cute," a <<person>> says.
	<br>
	"That new <<if $player.gender_appearance is "m">>bull<<else>>cow<</if>> you mean," a <<person2>><<person>> responds.
	<br>
	"Right. Tasty looking thing."
	<br>
	"Just don't get any ideas. Remy don't like us interfering."
	<br><br>
	They walk out of earshot.
	<br><br>
<</addinlineevent>>

<<addinlineevent "livestock_overhear 9">>
	"Wish they let us see the photos," a <<person>> says.
	<br>
	"Aye," a <<person2>><<person>> responds. "Asked that photographer for a peek. <<nnpc_He "Niki">> ignored me."
	<br>
	"They must be selling em to someone."
	<br>
	"Perverts richer than us, I guess."
	<br><br>
	They walk out of earshot.

		"That pregnant <<girl>> is cute," a <<person>> says.
		<br>

		<br>
		"Who knows? Be careful what you say, don't want to scare the cattle."
