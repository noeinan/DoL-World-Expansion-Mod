	You wake up sometime later inside a farmhouse. You're lying on a couch with a blanket over you. A small table holding a cup of tea sits nearby.

	Alex is walking up and down the room, phone in hand. "I know how long it's going to take. I need an ambulance now!" <<His>> gaze turns to you. "Holy shit, are you alright?"
	<br><br>
	You nod.
	<br><br>
	"Cancel that." Alex sighs, rubbing their face from the obvious stress of the situation. <<He>> approaches you. "Some thugs were carting you off. They drugged you. Don't worry," Alex strokes your hair. "I'm not letting them take what's mine."

	Getting up, <<he>> begins to <<if $daystate isnot "night">>walk outside<<else>>walk upstairs<</if>>. <<He>> looks towards you, "Rest up as long as you need."

	<br><br>
<<else>>
	You awaken in a wooden interior on top of a sofa. A figure looms over you, causing you to panic. No doubt they're ready to abduct you as a sex slave. Shouting, you flail your arms about at the figure, trying to push them away from you. A small wooden table falls over, spilling a cup onto the floor.
	<br><br>
	The figure yelps in pain but approaches you again. They grasp your wrists and straddle your belly, pinning you in place.
	<br><br>
	"It's me!" Alex's voice comes from the figure. "What's gotten into you?"
	<br><br>
	Clarity reaches your mind, causing you to stop struggling. You see Alex looking down at your tear strewn face. <<He>> sighs in relief and lets you go.
	<br><br>
	"Sorry, but you were about ready to hurt yourself," Alex looks at you. "You went full mental jacket there. Though given what just happened, I don't blame you." <<His>> rubs the back of <<his>> neck. "I'm not about ready for someone to take what's mine, don't worry. Rest as long as you need."

	Alex cleans up the mess and steps away. You stare at your shaking hands before getting up off the couch.
