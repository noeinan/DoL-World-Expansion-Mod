	Your mind clears, and you stop struggling. Alex looks down at your tear-strewn face. <<He>> sighs in relief and releases you.

	"Sorry, but you were about ready to hurt yourself," <<he>> says. "You went full mental jacket there. Though given what just happened, I don't blame you." <<He>> rubs the back of <<his>> neck. "I'm not about ready for someone to take what's mine, don't worry. Rest as long as you need."
