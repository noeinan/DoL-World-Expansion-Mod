	You enter the strange building. The interior is dark and crowded by tall shelves, holding all manner of items. The quiet is broken by a scraping, then a thud. A <<if $pronoun is "m">>boy<<else>>girl<</if>> holding a stepladder appears at the end of the closest aisle.
	<br><br>
	"A customer!" <<he>> says, dropping the ladder and walking over. <<He>> wipes <<his>> hands on <<his>> apron. "Welcome to my shop."
	<br><br>
	<<He>> looks about your age, with mousy hair and a hint of freckles. "I'm older than I look," <<he>> says, as if reading your mind. "I'm Gwylan," <<he>> reaches forward, lifts your hand from beside your waist, and shakes it in both <<his>> own. "Pleased to meet you. I sell-," <<he>> pauses. "My grand<<if $pronoun is "m">>father<<else>>mother<</if>> sells-" another pause. "I sell knick-knacks here. Things you won't find in normal shops. Even I don't know what I have in stock!" <<He>> sounds proud.
	<br><br>
	"I hope you find something you like," <<he>> says, picking the ladder back up. "But don't worry if you don't. My grand<<if $pronoun is "m">>father<<else>>mother<</if>> would say the objects here hide from people they don't want to be bought by." <<He>> laughs. "I could believe it."

	You are in the forest shop. The interior is dark and crowded by tall shelves, holding all manner of items. Most are useless knick-knacks, but some interest you.
	<br><br>
	You hear Gwylan shuffling somewhere in the gloom.
