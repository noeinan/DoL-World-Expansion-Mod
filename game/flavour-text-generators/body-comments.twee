:: Body Comment Random Flavour Text Widgets [widget]
/* We have lists of remarks separated based on contextual relevance to let the user determine what's needed and offer variety without repeating ourselves.
 * It also allows us to separate our data depending on what would and wouldn't make sense to hear in a given situation, there's no sense in rejecting someone
 * for their penis size if the actual agent is about to sit on their dick.

/*
 * penis size
 * I've grouped things into categories to make them easier to fit to specific uses, questioning and asserting that a penis is useless is inappropriate
 * in some cases but in other cases affection is inappropriate
 *
 * the current groupings I've chosen for what I've come up with are as follows:
 * affection: all comments expressing affection towards the persons size
 * size_remarks: plain descriptions of lack of size
 * surprise: all comments expressing surprise or incredulity at their size or lack of size (think comments with "how" in them)
 * insult: all derisive comments intended to hurt the persons feelings
 * question_use: all questions suggesting the penis is unfit for purpose
 * assert_useless: flat out assert the penis is useless

/*
 * sod it, ugly messy shit with 0 regard for scope it is, because twine hates us all
 * this is how were going to output text, were going to modify this thing wherever we like
 * may god have mercy upon my soul
