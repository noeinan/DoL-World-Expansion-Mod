<<set $outside to 0>><<set $location to "cabin">><<effects>>

You tell Eden about your grievances. It stars out small at first. You begin by describing how you've been continuously approached. Somehow, in the minutes that pass, the conversation spirals into you detailing about the suffering you've went through.
About how you're so overwhelmed by everything. You're vaguely aware that you've started crying.
<br><br>

Eden's touch brings you back to reality. <<He>> gently swipes <<his>> thumb over your cheeks in an attempt to dry them. You look up at <<him>> through your sobs. Though blurred by tears, <<his>> face is still visible. A storm of emotions swirl in <<his>> eyes.
<<He>> pulls you into <<his>> chest as your crying subsides. You breathe in <<his>> scent. It's comforting.

You and Eden stay curled up by the fire for some time. The silence is only broken by the crackling of embers and your sniffling. Eventually, Eden tries to speak. <<He>> stutters through <<his>> words, starting and breaking off sentences.
After a few attempts, <<he>> manages to get something out.
<br><br>

"I don't know what to say." <<His>> voice sounds disbelieving, sad, and angry. You're not sure if <<his>> anger is directed at your attackers, or at <<him>>self. "I should have been there," he says, holding you tighter. "I should have protected you." Tighter.
"I should have shot anyone who even tried to touch you." <<His>> hold is almost painful now. "I should have-" you wince at the strength of <<his>> embrace. Eden immediately loosens <<his>> hold on you and goes quiet again.
<br><br>

It takes a bit, but you eventually summon the energy to speak. In a whisper, you tell <<him>> that it's okay. That <<he>> doesn't need to blame <<him>>self for anything you went through. Eden pulls a conflicted expression at your words. "I don't know how to help you," <<he>> says.
"I wish I could have done something. Anything." <<He>> starts to squeeze you again, but stops <<him>>self. You could be imagining it, but it feels like <<his>> arms are trembling.

<<if $submissive gte 1150>>
	"Y-you're talking to me now," you say. "That counts."
<<elseif $submissive lte 850>>
	"You're talking to me now," you say. "That's something."

	"At least you're talking to me now," you say.

"I don't want you leaving again," <<he>> says. You look up at <<him>>. "It's too dangerous." You frown at <<his>> words.
<br><br>

<<if $submissive gte 1150>>
	"I-I can't do that," you say.
<<elseif $submissive lte 850>>
	"You know I can't do that," you say.
<<else>>
	"I can't do that," you say.
<</if>>
<br>
"Why not?" <<He>> asks. "You have everything you need here."
<br>
<<if $submissive gte 1150>>
	"I-I have obligations." You avoid his gaze. "You're being selfish."
<<elseif $submissive lte 850>>
	"I have obligations in town. Making me stay here is selfish."
<<else>>
	"I have obligations. It's selfish to make me stay."
<</if>>
<br>
"I'm being selfish?" <<He>> sounds exasperated. "I'm trying to protect you!"
<br>
<<if $submissive gte 1150>>
	"I-I know" you whisper. "But, I'll have to go back eventually."
<<elseif $submissive lte 850>>
	"I know, but that doesn't change anything. I'll still have to go back eventually."
<<else>>
	"I know, but I'll still have to go back eventually."
<</if>>
<br><br>

Eden tries to retort, but looks away and sighs. "Fine," <<he>> says. "I won't stop you." You smile weakly at <<him>> and bury your face in <<his>> chest. <<He>> strokes your hair in response.
For a moment, the both of you stay silent, content to remain tangled in each other's arms. The peace is momentarily broken by the sound of Eden's voice. "I'm here if you need me," <<he>> says.
You nod. The two of you watch the embers crackle into the night.
<br><br>

<i>You can now talk to Eden if your trauma is too high.</i>
