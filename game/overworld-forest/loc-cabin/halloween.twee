<<npc Eden>><<person1>>

Orange autumn leaves decorate the trees of the forest, covering the ground and crunching under your feet as you approach Eden, the hamper of sweets in your hands. <<He>> momentarily looks up from <<his>> work to regard you, but stops when <<he>> notices what you're holding.
<br><br>

<<if $submissive gte 1150>>
	"H-Happy Halloween," you say, holding the hamper out to <<him>>.
<<elseif $submissive lte 850>>
	"Happy Halloween," you say, pushing the hamper into <<his>> hands.
<<else>>
	"Happy Halloween," you say, passing the hamper to <<him>>.
<</if>>
<br><br>

"Sweets?" <<He>> asks, looking your gift over. "This is unexpected."
<br>

<<if $submissive gte 1150>>
	"Well, s-since you don't trick-or-treat, I thought I could bring the sweets to you," you say.
<<elseif $submissive lte 850>>
	"Even if you don't go trick-or-treating, there's no reason not to have sweets," you say.
<<else>>
	"I just thought you'd appreciate it since you don't go trick or treating," you say.
<</if>>
<br><br>

Eden glances at the hamper again, an unsure but grateful look in <<his>> eyes. "Thanks," <<he>> says. "It's nice, not that I eat a lot of sweets anyway."
As <<he>> walks to the kitchen to store the hamper away, you notice a knife and a few pumpkins on the dining table, their stark orange hue reminding you of the seasonal foliage.
<br><br>

Eden notices your gaze and stops, placing the hamper down. "I was planning on making pumpkin pie," <<he>> says, eyeing the spread on the table.

You nod your head in response. Eden opens a nearby cabinet to store the sweets away, but suddenly changes <<his>> mind and looks to you.
<br><br>
"Why don't you share these with me," <<he>> asks.
<br><br>

<<elseif $submissive lte 850>>
	"I got these sweets for you. It's yours."
<<else>>
	"I bought the sweets for you."

<br><br>

Eden shrugs and stores the hamper in the cabinet. <<He>> goes over to you and kisses your forehead.
<br>
"Thanks again," <<he>> says, before walking away.

"Can we carve pumpkins?" You ask.
<br><br>
"What?" <<He>> questions, pulling an incredulous expression. "I was saving these for pie, not carving."
<br>

<<if $submissive gte 1150>>
	"Please?" You say.
<<elseif $submissive lte 850>>
	"Oh come on, it's Halloween!" You say.
<<else>>
	"But it's Halloween," you say.
<</if>>
<br><br>

Eden sighs and looks away, considering for a moment, before looking back to you. "Fine," <<he>> says. "But we're only using two of them."
<br><br>
You smile at <<him>> in thanks and walk over.

Using your knife, you whittle away at the surface of the pumpkin.

<<if $tending gte 150>>
	<<if $phase is 0>>
		It takes a while, but the finishing result looks rather scary.
	<<elseif $phase is 1>>
		It takes a while, but the finishing result looks rather cute.
	<<elseif $phase is 2>>
		It takes a while, but the finishing result looks relatively similar to Eden.
	<</if>>
<<else>>

	<<if $phase is 0>>
		You try your best, but the carving doesn't look very scary.
	<<elseif $phase is 1>>
		You try your best, but the carving doesn't look very cute.
	<<elseif $phase is 2>>
		You try your best, but the carving doesn't look very similar to Eden.
	<</if>>
<</if>>
<br><br>

Stepping back from your work, you walk over to Eden to look at <<his>> creation. It seems <<he>>'s carved the image of a deer into the pumpkin. It looks quite skillfully done, no doubt from how experienced <<he>> is with <<his>> hands.
<br><br>

<<if $submissive gte 1150>>
	"Y-your pumpkin looks cute," you say.
<<elseif $submissive lte 850>>
	"That's a cute pumpkin," you say.
<<else>>
	"That pumpkin looks cute," you say.
<</if>>
<br><br>

Eden turns <<his>> head to face you. "If pumpkins are cute, maybe I should start calling you pumpkin too," <<he>> laughs, playfully smacking your ass.
<br><br>

After a while, Eden drops <<his>> knife and walks over to you, evaluating your carving.

<<if $tending gte 150>>
	<<if $phase is 0>>
		"Wow, that's scary," <<he>> says. <<He>> looks impressed.
	<<elseif $phase is 1>>
		"Wow, that's cute," <<he>> says. <<He>> looks impressed.
	<<elseif $phase is 2>>
		<<He>> drinks in your work with a look of slight surprise on <<his>> face, almost unbelieving of what <<he>> sees.
		"Is that me?" <<He>> asks, turning <<his>> head to you.
		<br>

		<<if $submissive gte 1150>>
			You nod your head.
		<<elseif $submissive lte 850>>
			"Yeah," you say.

			"Yes," you say.

		<br><br>

		"That's good," <<he>> says, nodding slightly.
	<</if>>
	<br><br>
<<else>>
	<<He>> stares at it for a bit, trying to discern what it's supposed to be.
	<br>

	<<if $phase is 0>>
		"It's supposed to be scary," you say.
	<<elseif $phase is 1>>
		"It's supposed to be cute," you say.
	<<elseif $phase is 2>>
		"It's supposed to be you," you say.

	<br><br>
	Eden shoots you a smirk. "It's a good effort," <<he>> says, patting you on the head.

After a short deliberation, the both of you decide to decorate the cabin with your work. Eden opens the wooden door and you feel the cool autumn air hit your face.
<br><br>
<<He>> places the pumpkins near the entrance. They add a slight festive touch, contrasting the austere nature of the cabin.
<br><br>
When you're done admiring your work, you and Eden walk back inside. Looking to the table again, your eyes are drawn to the hamper of sweets.
<br><br>

<<if $submissive gte 1150>>
	"Y-you haven't eaten the sweets yet," you say.
<<elseif $submissive lte 850>>
	"Hey, you still haven't tried the sweets yet," you say.
<<else>>
	"You haven't tried the sweets yet," you say.

Eden looks to the table, seemingly contemplating something. "Why don't you share them with me?" <<He>> asks.

You accept Eden's offer and walk to the table. Grabbing one of the knives, <<he>> cuts open the hamper's protective plastic and reaches for a small box tucked within its center.
<br><br>
Upon opening, you both find that it's filled with creamy chocolate. Its delectable scent wafts up your nose and your mouth waters in response.
<br><br>
Taking a piece, Eden brings it to <<his>> mouth.

	Just before the chocolate enters <<his>> mouth, you snatch it from Eden and gobble it up.

	"Hey!" Eden exclaims, turning to you.
	<br>
	<<if $submissive gte 1150>>
		"Y-you told me we were sharing," you tease.

		"What? You did tell me we were sharing," you tease.
	<<else>>
		"You told me we were sharing," you tease.
	<</if>>
	<br><br>

	Eden opens <<his>> mouth to retort, but stops. <<His>> eyes glint and a mischevious smirk spreads across <<his>> face. "Okay. We're sharing," <<he>> says, slowly and tantalizingly swiping <<his>> finger over one of the chocolates.
	<br><br>
	<<He>> brings <<his>> chocolate-coated finger up to your mouth, looking at you with heated eyes.
	<br><br>
	"Come on," <<he>> says. "I know you want to."
	<br><br>
<<else>>
	You watch Eden eat the piece of chocolate. <<He>> seems to enjoy its sweetness.
	<br><br>
	"Haven't eaten chocolate in a while," <<he>> says. Turning to you, <<he>> offers you the box. "Want one?"
	<br><br>
	You're about to reply, before Eden perks up. <<His>> eyes glint and a mischevious smirk spreads across <<his>> face. "I think I can make this more interesting," <<he>> says, slowly and tantalizingly swiping <<his>> finger over one of the chocolates.
	<br><br>
	<<He>> brings <<his>> chocolate-coated finger up to your mouth, looking at you with heated eyes.

You slowly encase your mouth around <<his>> finger. Using your tongue, you lick and suck the chocolate off. Eden stares at you hungrily, holding your gaze the entire time.

"Good <<girl>>," <<he>> says, sliding <<his>> finger down your tongue and popping it out of your mouth. <<He>> reaches into the box.
<br><br>
"Since you did so well with that," <<he>> says, picking up a piece and placing it between <<his>> teeth. <<He>> pulls you closer.

The cabin is silent, save for the sound of Eden shuffling off the floor. <<He>> extends <<his>> hand towards you and helps pull you up. Sitting you on a nearby chair, <<he>> gently lifts your chin and plants a soft kiss on your lips.

"Thanks for the sweets," <<he>> says. <<He>> grabs the hamper off the table. "And for celebrating Halloween with me."
