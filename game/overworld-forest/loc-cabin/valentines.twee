You run the bath, adding the bath oils as the tub fills. The scent of the oil permeates the air and spreads throughout the cabin. You strip and settle in the water just as you hear Eden enter.

Eden's footsteps momentarily pause by the door before you hear them tentatively approach the bathroom. Surprise adorns <<his>> face as <<he>> enters and takes in the sight of you, waiting for <<him>> naked and splayed out in <<his>> tub.
Seeing <<his>> expression, you throw <<him>> a coy smile and beckon <<him>> over. The shock on <<his>> face quickly melts into love as <<he>> chuckles and strips, walking over to you.
<br><br>

"This is unexpected," <<he>> says, climbing in the tub.

You and Eden relax in the tub. You feel <<his>> gaze slide up your body, until <<he>> meets your eyes. You smile at <<him>> and <<he>> faintly smiles back.
<br><br>
You both continue staring into each other's eyes. <<His>> expression is unusually soft as <<he>> looks at you.
<br><br>

You grab the sponge and hold it up. Eden turns <<his>> back to you and you start scrubbing. After finishing, you try to place the sponge down, but Eden stops you.
<br><br>
"Do you want me to wash you too?" <<He>> asks.

<br><br>
<<He>> smiles at your laughter and lays a gentle kiss on your neck before continuing.

After a while, the water starts to get cold. Eden slowly begins to sit up.
<br><br>

"I think we should get up now," <<he>> says, rising out of the tub.
<br>
<<if $submissive gte 1150>>
	"I-I thought you usually stay in," you say, watching as <<he>> steps onto the floor.

<<else>>
	"I thought you usually stay in for a bit longer," you say, watching as <<he>> steps onto the floor.

<br>

Eden looks away from you, sporting a slight blush. "I thought we could spend more time together." You can't help but smile at <<his>> bashfulness.
<br><br>

After helping you out of the tub, the both of you dry off and leave the bathroom.

As you step into the cabin's living area, the melody playing from the radio catches your attention. Something about it sounds strangely familiar. Then it hits you. It's the song. The first song that you and Eden danced to.
<br><br>

You glance at Eden. By the look on <<his>> face, it seems <<hes>> had the same realization as you. A look of determination flashes across <<his>> face and <<he>> turns to you. There's no hesitation this time. Being the first to act, 
<<he>> wraps <<his>> hands around your waist and pulls you towards <<him>>. Your wind yours around <<his>> neck in turn, and once again, begin your slow waltz around the cabin.
<br><br>

<<effects>>

As the Eden holds you in <<his>> arms, the rest of the world seems to fade away. Even though you've danced before, this moment seems different. It's a familiar mix of tenderness and nostalgic vulnerability. Eden seems to feel it too, and although <<hes>> improved,
a recognizable, but no less endearing clumsiness leaks into <<his>> movements. As a matter of fact, <<his>> light blush and awkward missteps bring you back to the way <<he>> bared <<his>> heart to you in the first dance you shared.
<br><br>

You look back at the memory and realize that this is what makes Eden who <<he>> is. Through <<his>> outer brashness to the softness <<he>> hides deep down, you see how much Eden has tried for you, and as a result, how far you've come together. 
It makes you realize that even if <<he>> may not know how to say it, it's through moments like these, moments of bumbling laughter and static-filled love songs, moments that belong to the both of you, that truly show the genuine depths of <<his>> love.
<br><br>

The song comes to an end, and for a moment, you and Eden stay still, holding each other as the world comes rushing back. After a few seconds, Eden captures your lips in a sweet kiss. It's as genuine as you remember, but it warms your heart all the same.
<br><br>

Stepping away from Eden, you walk to the cabinet where you hid the romance book and pull it out. <<He>> raises <<his>> eyebrows as you hand it to <<him>>. "Wow," <<he>> chuckles, turning the book over in <<his>> hands.
"You're full of surprises today." <<He>> pauses for a second, seemingly contemplating something.
<br><br>

"We have some time before dinner. Feel like reading this now?" <<He>> asks, glancing to you.

<</if>>

Eden looks at you quizzically, but shrugs. "Sure," <<he>> says, handing you the book. You and Eden walk over to the fireplace and <<he>> starts to get the fire going.
Once the flames burn strongly, <<he>> settles onto the floor, holding an arm out for you. When you're comfortably snuggled into <<his>> chest, you open the book and start reading.
<br><br>

Halfway through the first chapter, you feel Eden kiss your neck. You pause and try to face <<him>>, but <<he>> doesn't stop. Eden brings <<his>> lips to your ear. "Keep going," <<he>> whispers, as <<he>> slides <<his>> hand over your stomach.
<br><br>

It's getting hard to read while Eden's distracting you.

Eden reads to you for some time, until <<he>> stops, looking out at the window. You shift your gaze to the scenery outside and see that it's getting dark out. "I need to start dinner," <<he>> notes. 
<br><br>

Before pulling away from you, Eden presses a gentle kiss to your forehead. "Thanks for today," <<he>> says, "and Happy Valentine's."
<br><br>

The both of you share one last smile as <<he>> stores the book away and walks to the kitchen.

Midway through the first chapter, you turn to Eden and lay a soft kiss on <<his>> neck. <<He>> abruptly stops reading and glances toward you. 
Deciding to take it a step further, you pepper <<his>> neck with kisses and slide your hands under <<his>> shirt, running it teasingly over <<his>> stomach.
Eden's breath starts to pick up.
<br><br>

Shifting <<his>> attention to you, <<he>> places the book aside and gently guides you onto the cabin floor.

The two of you lie on the cabin floor, the romance story long forgotten. After a bit, Eden lifts <<him>>self off you and helps you sit up. You both stay curled by the fireplace for a bit longer. Staring into the flames, part of you feels disheartened,
wishing that moments like these could last forever. Seeing Eden shift <<his>> gaze to the slowly darkening sky, you can tell <<he>> feels the same way.
<br><br>

<<if $edenradiointro is 2>>
	A short while later, Eden breaks the silence. "Thanks for today," <<he>> says, "and Happy Valentine's." As <<he>> presses a gentle kiss to your forehead, you come to another realization. Moments like these are special because of Eden's love. 
	Since it's something that <<he>> carries for you always, it means that every moment with <<him>> is special, from <<his>> clumsy attempts at dancing to the way <<hes>> holding you now. And as Eden whispers three special words to you so softly that you can barely hear it,
	you smile, because you know that as long as you're together, moments like these never truly have to end.
