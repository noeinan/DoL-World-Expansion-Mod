Inside, you run the bath, adding the bath oil to the water as the tub fills; the pleasant aroma that ensues permeates the air throughout the cabin. You strip bare, and sink into the soothing hot water as you hear Eden enter.

Eden's footsteps momentarily pause by the door before you hear them tentatively approach the bathroom. Surprise adorns <<his>> face as <<he>> enters and takes in the sight of you, waiting for <<him>> naked and splayed out in <<his>> tub.
Seeing <<his>> expression, you throw <<him>> a coy smile and beckon <<him>> over. The shock on <<his>> face quickly melts into love as <<he>> chuckles and strips, walking over to you.
<br><br>

"This is unexpected," <<he>> says, climbing in the tub.

You and Eden relax in the tub. You feel <<his>> gaze slide up your body, until <<he>> meets your eyes. You smile at <<him>> and <<he>> faintly smiles back.

You both continue staring at one another with tender desire, <<his>> expression unusually soft as <<he>> regards you.

You grab the sponge and hold it up. Eden turns <<his>> back to you and you start scrubbing. After finishing, you try to place the sponge down, but Eden stops you.
<br><br>
"Do you want me to wash you too?" <<he>> asks.

You turn your back to Eden, and <<he>> starts scrubbing you all over. Part way through, <<he>> hits a particularly ticklish spot. You bring your hands up to your mouth and barely stifle a giggle, but Eden notices all the same.
<br><br>
<<He>> smiles at your laughter and lays a gentle kiss on your neck before continuing.

After a while, the water starts to get cold. Eden slowly begins to sit up.
<br><br>

"I think we should get up now," <<he>> says, rising out of the water.

<<if $submissive gte 1150>>

Eden looks away from you, sporting a slight blush. "I thought we could spend more time together." You can't help but smile at <<his>> rare display of bashfulness.
<br><br>

<<He>> helps you out of the tub and the both of you dry off before leaving the bathroom together, hand in hand.

As you step into the cabin's living area, the melody playing from the radio catches your attention. Something about it sounds strangely familiar. Then it hits you. It's the song. The first song that you and Eden danced to.
<br><br>

You glance at Eden. By the look on <<his>> face, it seems <<hes>> had the same realisation as you. A look of determination flashes in <<his>> eyes and <<he>> turns to you. There's no hesitation this time. Being the first to act,
<<he>> wraps <<his>> hands around your waist and pulls you towards <<him>>. You wind yours around <<his>> neck in turn, and once again, begin your slow waltz around the cabin.
<br><br>

<<effects>>

As Eden holds you in <<his>> arms, the rest of the world seems to fade away. Even though you've danced before, this moment seems different. It's a familiar mix of tenderness and nostalgic vulnerability. Eden seems to feel it too, and although <<hes>> improved,
a recognisable, but no less endearing clumsiness leaks into <<his>> movements. As a matter of fact, <<his>> light blush and awkward missteps bring you back to the way <<he>> bared <<his>> heart to you in the first dance you shared.
<br><br>

You look back at the memory and realise that this is what makes Eden who <<he>> is. Through <<his>> outer brashness to the softness <<he>> hides deep down, you see how much Eden has tried for you, and as a result, how far you've come together.
It makes you realise that even if <<he>> may not know how to say it, it's through moments like these, moments of bumbling laughter and static-filled love songs, moments that belong to the both of you, that truly show the genuine depths of <<his>> love.
<br><br>

The song comes to an end, and for a moment, you and Eden stay still. Time stops and you share a private slice of forever in that moment together. It passes in mere seconds but to the two of you it is an eternity, one that ends far too soon.
As the world comes rushing back, Eden captures your lips in a sweet kiss. It's as genuine as you remember, but it warms your heart all the same.
<br><br>

Stepping away from Eden, you walk to the cabinet where you hid the romance book and pull it out. <<He>> raises <<his>> eyebrows as you hand it to <<him>>. "Wow," <<he>> chuckles, turning the book over in <<his>> hands.
"You're full of surprises today." <<He>> pauses for a second, seemingly contemplating something.
<br><br>

"We have some time before dinner. Feel like reading this now?" <<he>> asks, glancing to you.

Eden looks at you quizzically, but shrugs. "Sure," <<he>> says, handing you the book. You accompany Eden to the fireplace where <<he>> sets the book down and begins to get the fire going. Once the flames burn high, <<he>> sits and takes hold of the literature, motioning for you to join <<him>> on the floor.
When you're comfortably snuggled into <<his>> chest, you open the book and start reading.
<br><br>

Halfway through the first chapter, you feel Eden kiss your neck. You pause and try to face <<him>>, but <<he>> doesn't stop. Eden brings <<his>> lips to your ear. "Keep going," <<he>> whispers, as <<he>> slides <<his>> hand over your stomach.
<br><br>

It's getting hard to read while Eden's distracting you.

Eden reads to you for some time, until <<he>> stops, looking out at the window. You shift your gaze to the scenery outside and see that it's getting dark out. "I need to start dinner," <<he>> notes.
<br><br>

Before pulling away from you, Eden presses a gentle kiss to your forehead. "Thanks for today," <<he>> says, "and Happy Valentine's."
<br><br>

The both of you share one last smile as <<he>> stores the book away and walks to the kitchen.

Midway through the first chapter, you turn to Eden and lay a soft kiss on <<his>> neck. <<He>> abruptly stops reading and glances toward you.
Deciding to take it a step further, you pepper <<his>> neck with kisses and slide your hands under <<his>> shirt, running it teasingly over <<his>> stomach.
Eden's breath starts to pick up.
<br><br>

Shifting <<his>> attention to you, <<he>> places the book aside and gently guides you onto the cabin floor.

The two of you lie on the cabin floor, the romance story long forgotten. After a bit, Eden lifts <<him>>self off you and helps you sit up. You both stay curled by the fireplace for a bit longer. Staring into the flames, part of you feels disheartened,
wishing that moments like these could last forever. Seeing Eden shift <<his>> gaze to the slowly darkening sky, you can tell <<he>> feels the same way.
<br><br>

<<if $edenradiointro is 2>>
	A short while later, Eden breaks the silence. "Thanks for today," <<he>> says, "and Happy Valentine's." As <<he>> presses a gentle kiss to your forehead, you come to another realisation. Moments like these are special because of Eden's love.
	Since it's something that <<he>> carries for you always, it means that every moment with <<him>> is special, from <<his>> clumsy attempts at dancing to the way <<hes>> holding you now. And as Eden whispers three special words to you so softly that you can barely hear it,
	you smile, because you know that as long as you're together, moments like these never truly have to end.
