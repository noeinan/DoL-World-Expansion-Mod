:: Eden Jacket
<<set $outside to 0>><<set $location to "cabin">><<effects>>

Snow falls around the cabin, painting the scenery a pure white. A distinctive winter chill settles in you, causing you to shiver. When you find Eden, <<he>>'s as busy as always.
You call <<him>> over and hand <<him>> the hunting jacket. "Merry Christmas," you say.
<br><br>
Eden looks taken aback. "Is it Christmas already?" <<he>> asks. Taking the hunting jacket, <<he>> turns it over and inspects it, then goes to the cabin mirror and tries it on. Looks like you bought the right size.
<br><br>
"Thanks," <<he>> says. "I wasn't expecting anything."
<br>

<<if $submissive gte 1150>>
"Well, y-you did say you didn't know it was Christmas today," you say.
<<elseif $submissive lte 850>>
"Makes sense, since you didn't know it was Christmas and all," you say.
<<else>>
"Well, you said didn't realise it was Christmas," you say.
<</if>>

<br><br>
Eden shoots you a look, but can't argue with your point. "I didn't prepare anything for you," <<he>> says.
You're about to tell <<him>> that <<he>> didn't need to do anything, but <<he>> stops you. "Hang on."

<<npc Eden>><<person1>>Eden busies <<him>>self with gathering ingredients, preparing something. You roam around the cabin, trying to peek over <<his>> shoulder or at least help <<him>> out. Your efforts are for naught though, as <<he>> insists that you let <<him>> handle everything tonight. As <<he>> starts cooking, a mouth-watering scent fills the cabin, adding to the anticipation of the moment.
<br><br>
<<He>> calls you to the table after a long wait. A beautiful meal for two is laid out. It looks as good as it smells. You look to Eden and <<he>> seems a bit worn out, but proud of <<him>>self. You think it's the most effort Eden's ever put into cooking before.

You and Eden take a seat, and you try a bite of the food. It's delicious and bursting with flavor. You're about to take another bite, but stop when you notice that Eden isn't eating. In fact, <<he>> looks tense as <<he>> glances between you and the food.
<br><br>
It's not usual for <<him>> to be nervous. In an attempt to reassure <<him>>, you smile and compliment <<his>> work. <<He>> looks relieved by your words, and starts eating. <<He>> still seems doubtful.
<br><br>
You chat with Eden over the meal, attempting to lighten the mood. <<He>>'s as quiet as always, but seems more attentive than usual today. Halfway through, <<he>> looks up, as if just remembering something. Going to a nearby cabinet, <<he>> pulls out a fancy looking bottle of bourbon. You wonder how you've never seen it in the cabin before.
<br><br>
<<He>> goes back to the table and prepares two glasses. "Want some?" <<he>> asks.

	You decline, and <<he>> shrugs. "More for me," <<he>> says, as <<he>> fills <<his>> glass.

After you're done, <<he>> clears the table and invites you over to the fireplace. In the frosty cold of the winter season, the flames seem twice as warm.
<<if $phase is 1>>
	Or maybe it's the alcohol causing the heat.
<</if>>
You turn to Eden, and <<he>> smiles at you, trailing <<his>> hand down your side. <<He>> rests your chin on <<his>> fingers, and moves <<his>> face closer to yours.

<<npc Eden>><<person1>>
The two of you bask in the peaceful stillness of the night. In the glow of the flames, Eden looks almost ethereal. You look at <<him>>, entranced, until <<he>> breaks the silence. "I'd always spend my Christmas alone," <<he>> says, "but I'm glad you're here."
You smile in response, and <<he>> gently weaves <<his>> hand through your hair, returning your gaze with <<his>> own.
<br><br>
"You're the best thing that's ever happened to me," <<he>> whispers, as <<he>> kisses your forehead. Snow continues to fall around the cabin, but you no longer feel the biting chill. Instead, the warmth of Eden's love surrounds you as you lay pressed against <<his>> chest.
