The <<beasttype>> tries to stand, but it's too late. Several sets of jaws clamp down on it's body. It roars in pain and swipes at the attackers, but they jump back to safety.
<br><br>

Groggy and hurt, the <<beasttype>> stumbles away from the cave and leaves the deer carcass unguarded. <<if $monster is 1>>"Thieving wolves... take the deer if you want it so badly!<</if>> The Black Wolf keeps the choice parts for itself. You find some berries growing nearby which serve you better.

		The Black Wolf calls you over. "Bear no match for pack strength. <<pPackbrother>> did well."
	<</if>>

	The pack lazes around, eating at their leisure. A small dispute breaks out and the Black Wolf leaves <<bhis>> place by the deer to quell it.

The Black Wolf lunges, but the <<beasttype>> is too quick. <<bHe>> swipes the Black Wolf to the side, and the other <<wolf_cave_plural>> turn and flee. The Black Wolf follows, unhurt save for <<nnpc_his "Black Wolf">> pride.
<br><br>

<i>Higher harmony and ferocity increases the chance of a successful hunt.</i>
<br><br>

You run with the pack into the forest. There must be easier prey.
