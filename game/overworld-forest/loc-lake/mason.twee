You swim into the middle of the lake. There Mason swims in a wide circle. <<He>> notices you approach, and faces you, treading water.
<br><br>

"It's nice to see you out here," <<he>> says. "If it's okay though, I'd like to continue my laps." <<He>> swims away before you can get close.

	<br><br>

	"I-I see someone's been paying attention in class," <<he>> says. <<He>> holds <<his>> arms beneath the water in a strange way, close to <<his>> body. "If only the rest of the class were so capable. We'd have our own swim team."

	"I-I," <<he>> begins, voice quivering. "I prefer swimming like this. It's just more fun."

	"I-I didn't expect to see a student out here," <<he>> says as you wipe water from your eyes. <<He>> holds <<his>> arms beneath the water in a strange way, close to <<his>> body. "Though I'm glad to see you practising outside school hours."
