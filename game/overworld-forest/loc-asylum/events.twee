	"That's right," Doctor Harper says. "Thank you. This is good for her. We have a device placed inside her vagina, another on her clitoris,

	"You were dancing for them on the beach," <<he>> says. "In swimwear. You enjoyed them watching you, you liked their attention, but it wasn't enough.

	Harper cuts away her swimwear, exposing first her breasts, then her pussy.

The compartment clangs shut. A dim light fills the interior, though you can't see the source. "Are you comfortable in there?" asks Harper's muffled voice. "I'm turning it on." The light becomes more intense. Small holes open on the top and sides of the chamber. A pink mist flows out. It smells sweet. You feel warm.
<br><br>
<<set $drugged += 180>>
Several dozen tendrils emerge next. They snake over your body, writhing against your skin,
<<if $worn.upper.name isnot "naked">>
	beneath your $worn.upper.name,
<</if>>
and against your <<breasts>>.
<<if $worn.under_lower.name isnot "naked">>
	Even your $worn.under_lower.name <<underlowerplural>> no protection.
<</if>>
They tease your <<genitals>> without mercy.
<br><br>
<<pass 5>>
This continues for a few minutes. Puffs of pink mist continue to emerge, along with more tendrils. Your breathing becomes deeper and your pulse quickens.
<br><br>
<<arousal 10000>>
<<orgasm>>
You hear applause from outside the machine. Did you make that much noise? "Very good," Harper says.
"That should do it. This should be the right button." The tendrils withdraw and the holes close. The compartment opens and several pairs of arms help you to your feet. "You've done well today," The doctor says. "I hope you found it relaxing. Be well."
<br><br>
You leave the room, still shaking.
