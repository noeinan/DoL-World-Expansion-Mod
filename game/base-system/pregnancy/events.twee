"You're experiencing strange sensations in your abdomen?" <<he>> asks. You nod. <<He>> wheels <<his>> chair closer, and places <<his>> stethoscope to your tummy.
<br><br>
<<He>> listens for a moment, then wheels away and types something into <<his>> computer. "You have a parasite problem," <<he>> says. "They're using you as part of their reproductive cycle." <<He>> notices the look on your face, and smiles. "Don't be concerned. They won't harm you. They'll remove themselves when they're ready."
<br><br>
<<He>> spends several minutes explaining how to "birth" the creatures. What to do, and what not to do. It sounds simple. Drop to all fours, and squeeze.
<br><br>
<<He>> turns back to <<his>> computer. "Species like this are of scientific interest," <<he>> continues. "If you're interested in making a bit of money, I'm able to pay you for them on behalf of a local company." <<He>> rises to <<his>> feet. "Is there anything else?"
<br><br>
You shake your head. <<He>> holds open the door for you, and you leave the office. "Be well," <<he>> says as you pass.

Doctor Harper walks over to <<his>> office door, and locks it. <<He>> sits back down. "What have you brought me today?" <<he>> asks.
<br><br>
You pull out the small container <<he>> gave you. <<He>> looks inside.

"Strange," <<he>> says. "N-not that there's anything to be alarmed about." <<He>> pulls <<his>> chair back to <<his>> computer and types something in.
<br><br>
You wait as <<he>> reads the screen, occasionally tapping on the keyboard. <<He>> pulls a large book from a drawer, blows off dust, and flips through the pages. At last, <<he>> puts the book away and turns to face you.
<br><br>
"You have a parasite," <<he>> says. "An unusual one. It has both sex organs, and is able to mate with itself. We'll need to perform a procedure here in order to remove it. Until then, you'll continue to birth its offspring."

"Please undress and lie on the table," <<he>> says while pulling on a latex glove. "No need to be shy." <<He>> turns and rummages through a drawer.
<br><br>

You <<nervously>> remove your clothing while <<his>> back is turned. You lie down on the table, conscious of your <<lewdness>>. <<His>> face neutral, the doctor grasps your legs and pushes them against your shoulders, before tying them down with straps.
<br><br>

"It will be easier if you're still," <<he>> affirms as <<he>> ties down your wrists. You can barely move.

<<if $worn.genitals.anal_shield is 1>>

<<He>> opens another drawer, and pulls out a smooth white rod with a round ball on one end. <<He>> pushes the thin end against your <<bottom>>. "Just relax,<<if pregnancyBellyVisible()>> this won't hurt the baby,<</if>>" <<he>> says. It slides in without pain, as if lubricated. Harper twists the other side, and you feel it pulse within you.
<<garousal>><<arousal 1200>>
<br><br>

Harper stares unblinking at your <<bottom>> as the pulsing increases in intensity. Just when you feel like you can't take any more, <<he>> eases it out. The <<if _pregnancy.namesChildren is true>>baby<<else>>parasite<</if>> is wrapped around the end<<if _extra is true>> alongside a smaller one<</if>>. <<He>> puts it in an opaque container, and seals it shut.
