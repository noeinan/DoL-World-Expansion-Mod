In a few moments <<childhe>>'s again sleeping peacefully as you return to what you were doing. <<lstress>><<stress -5>>

		Noticing the <<childtype>>'s restless sleep you move over to <<childhim>> and lay down beside. You pull <<childname>> against your chest and hold <<childhim>> and soon enough <<childhe>> calms down. Before you can stand however you notice <<childhe>> has your finger gripped tightly in <<chilldhis>> small hands.

		You walk over to <<childname>> and take <<childhim>> into your arms, hoisting <<childhim>> into the eye. The <<childtype>> is wide eyed at the change in <<childhis>> situation at first but then smiles and laughs. You repeat this several times and soon you have <<childname>> laughing endlessly and you cannot help but smile yourself. When you are done you return the <<childtype>>. <<llstress>><<stress -10>>
	<<case "talking">>
		You sit down next to <<childname>> and begin to converse with the talkative <<childtype>>. Although you can't understand one another <<childhe>> smiles at your presence and begins to make more excited noises as you talk to <<childhim>>.

Soon enough however <<childhe>> becomes distracted by <<childhis>> own hands and falls silent while you get back on your feet. <<llstress>><<stress -10>>
		<<set $children[$childActivityEvent.childid].localVariables.activity to "thumbSucking">>
	<<case "nappyChange">>
		You notice <<childname>> looking uncomfortable and notice a telling stink coming from <<childhim>>. You fetch a spare nappy and go over to <<childhim>>, laying him flat and removing the old nappy. You clean the <<childtype>>'s bottom diligently and place the fresh nappy on <<childhim>>. Freshly cleaned and changed, <<childname>> looks up at you and smiles before you go to dispose of the dirty nappy. <<gstress>><<stress 5>>

	<<case "crawlingAttempt">>
		Walking over to <<childname>> you see that <<childhe>> is stuck on <<childhis>> belly and is trying to move <<childhimself>> forward. You sit down next to the <<childtype>> and take <<childhis>> hands in your, place them on the floor and hold them there to give <<childhim>> leverage. Soon enough <<childname>> is pulling <<childhimself>> across the floor with your help, bewildered and amused at <<childhis>> own mobility. After a while <<childhe>> seems to get the hang of it and you leave <<childhim>> clumsily crawling on <<childhis>> own. <<lstress>><<stress -5>>

Confused at first <<childname>> flails <<childhis>> legs until <<childhe>> snags the ground with a kick and propels <<childhimself>> forward. <<childname's>> eyes go wide at the revelation and soon enough, with some effort and failed triesm, you have <<childhim>> moving with <<childhis>> own legs, and your help keeping him upright of course. After a while of this exercise <<childhe>> grows tired and you let <<childhim>> down again. <<llstress>><<stress -10>>

		<<childname>> sits alone and wears a scowl on <<childhis>> infant face. You walk over and sit down next to <<childhim>> but <<childhe>> seems to ignore you. Unable to help but smile at the grumpy child's expression you begin to tickle <<childhim>>. While perhaps not ticklish at this age <<childname>> is still deeply amused by your teasing fingers and the silly noises you make as you playfully attack <<childhis>> sides. Soon enough the scowl is gone and the <<childtype>> is giggling and smiling. Mission accomplished, you stand back up. <<lstress>><<stress -5>>
		<<set $children[$childActivityEvent.childid].localVariables.activity to "thumbSucking">>
	<<case "readingAttempt">>
		You walk over to <<childname>> and sit down before pulling <<childhim>> and the inverted book into your lap. Taking the book from the <<childtype>> you flip it about and begin to read it's simple words to <<childhim>>. <<childHe>> follows along with both your voice and the colorful pictures for some time but eventually becomes distracted by something else and rolls off of your lap to pursue it. <<lstress>><<stress -5>>

You take the toy in hand and give it a shake causing a cacophony of rattles to emanate from it. The <<childtype>> looks bewildered and intrigued as <<childhe>> reaches  for the strange thing.

Placing it on the floor you roll it back and forth saying “Vroom! Vroom!” You do this several times as <<childname>> watches completely enraptured before you hand it to <<childhim>>. <<childHe>> looks at the toy with curiosity before mimicking your actions, making excited attempts to copy your sounds. You are left smiling as you climb to your feet again. <<lstress>><<stress -5>><<ltrauma>><<trauma -2>>

	<<case "cuddleAndNap">>
		The wolf looks at you as you lay down next to it and <<childname>>. The sleepy pair adjust for you to join their cuddling and soon all three of you are snuggled closely together.

	<<case "cryingWolf">>
		You sit by the <<childcry>> <<childtype>> and pull <<childhim>> into your lap. You hum soothingly and stroke the <<childtype>>'s fur and give the occasional soft scratch to <<childhis>> ears. <<childname>> slowly grows calm and begins to doze under your gentle attention and soon is asleep.

	<<case "curiousGaze">>
		You follow <<childname>>'s gaze until you realize it is watching your legs. You walk in a circle and <<childhis>> eyes never leave your feet. Amused, you take a quick walk around the cave and the <<childtype>> follows you as best it can, constantly transfixed on your movement. Eventually <<childname>> grows bored and tired of this and lays down to rest, <<childhis>> curiosity seemingly sated. <<llstress>><<stress -10>>
		<<set $children[$childActivityEvent.childid].localVariables.activity to "sleeping">>
	<<case"longingGaze">>
		Noticing your <<childtype>>'s longing gaze you approach and reach between <<childhis>> ears and begin to gently scratch. <<childname>>'s tongue lolls from <<childhis>> mouth and <<childhe>> pants happily as you scritch <<childhis>> ears. <<childHe>> gives you a sad look as you finish and walk away.
	<<case"playFighting">>
		You keep a close eye on the two as they tussle playfully. Slowly the two grow tired of each other and playful nips and yips turn into snaps and growls. You go over and separate <<childname>> from <<childhis>> playmate before it can escalate any further, ensuring each has a break from the other and soon enough they are playing amiably again.
		<<set $children[$childActivityEvent.childid].localVariables.activity to "playing">>
	<<case "fieldTrip">>
		You see <<childname>> looking out of the cave curiously and walk over to <<childhim>>. <<childHis>> fascination with the outside world isn't even broken as you bend down and pick <<childhim>> up. You walk outside and take a quick tour of the surrounding area, the <<childtype>>'s eyes wide and scanning over anything and everything with great interest.

		You pick <<childhim>> up and pet him gently, keeping the poor <<childcry>> <<childtype>>'s attention off <<childhis>> hunger.
