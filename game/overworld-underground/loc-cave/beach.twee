	Water comes up to your neck. The cave ceiling dips beneath the surface nearby. That way leads outside, but you'll need to swim.

You open the chest. Silver glints inside. A compass. It looks valuable. A collector would know more.

:: Beach Cave Examine
<<effects>>


You peer into the chest, then feel along the walls.

	You feel a button, barely perceptible against the wood. You don't push it. Instead, you feel with your fingertip. There's a smaller button, set into the first. You push down with a nail, and <span class="green">a hidden compartment opens</span> from the base of the container.
	<br><br>
	<<set $antiquemoney += 4000>><<museumAntiqueStatus "antiqueleathermap" "found">>
	A leather scroll sits inside, bound by waxy string. You unfurl it. It's a map, and in good condition. A coastal settlement is depicted, squashed beside a forest. Lines criss-cross the sea, some of them dotted. A kraken has been drawn in the top left corner, and a dragon in the bottom right. A collector might know more.

	You feel a button, barely perceptible against the wood. You push it. The base of the chest snaps open, <span class="red">and a dart springs out.</span> It fires wide, but startles you. You drop the container. The water catches it, and sucks it down a thin crevice.<<gstress>><<stress 6>>

:: Beach Cave Up
<<effects>>

You dive beneath the water, and swim. The cave curves upward.

<<if $daystate is "night">>
	<<if $weather is "clear">>
		You swim toward the moonlight above, emerging in the cold night breeze.
	<<else>>
		Such is the darkness that it's hard to tell which way is up. You emerge into the cold night breeze before panic sets in.<<gstress>><<stress 6>>
	<</if>>
<<else>>
	You swim toward the light above, emerging in the cool sea breeze.

:: Beach Cave Entrance
<<set $location to "underground">><<set $outside to 0>><<effects>>


You swim into the cave, towards the soft light. Your hands grasp rock, and you pull yourself into a pocket of air. Bioluminescent lichen clings to the walls.
