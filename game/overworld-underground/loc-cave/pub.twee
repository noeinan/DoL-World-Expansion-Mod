	The crowd roars with laughter as your eyes adjust to the light. You're stood on a stage in the middle of an open part of the cave. Tables and chars surround you, all occupied by rough-looking <<people>>. Lights hang overhead, and the bar in the corner looks well-stocked.

	"I'm leaving," you say, prompting more laughter.
	<br>
	"Th-this isn't funny," the <<person>> stammers. "Do what <<pshe>> says."

Echoing laughter chases you through the cave, but they don't seem to be following.
