"Climb," says the young <<personsimple>>. "Before I change my mind." You reach forward, and feel a ladder.

You climb until your head bumps against something. "Watch your head," laughs the voice. "Just push it." You do so, and climb atop the ladder. You feel a breeze, and hear traffic all around. There's a metallic thud behind you
