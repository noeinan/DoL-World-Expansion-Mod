You are dragged through a door and down a flight of steps. You hear the sound of rushing water. At the bottom the <<person>> turns on a torch, revealing an old stone corridor leading away into darkness.
<<pass 15>>
<br><br>
After walking awhile you come to a metal door. The <<person2>><<person>> knocks, and is answered by a thin opening sliding apart near the top. It closes promptly, and the door opens.
<br><br>
<<endcombat>>
You are forced through the door and to your knees before a <<generate1>><<person1>><<person>>, who crouches and grabs your neck. <<He>> turns your head to examine one side of your face, then the other, then forces your mouth open and looks inside. "<<pShe>> will do," <<he>> says, standing up.

You enter another corridor, lined on one side with metal floor hatches. <<He>> opens one of them, and shoves you inside. You land on something soft at least. "Your role here is simple. Do as you're told. You don't want to know what happened to the last <<girl>> who made a fuss." <<He>> slams the hatch shut, plunging you into complete darkness.
<br><br>
You fumble around in the dark, and find you fell on what feels like a mattress. There's also a locked metal door and a tap in the corner, but the room is otherwise bare.

You carefully feel around the edge of the room, looking for anything that might help you get out. You don't find anything. Feeling helpless, you sit back down on the mattress, and feel a cool breeze caress your leg. You put your hands against the floor and feel it again, coming from beneath the mattress.
<br><br>
You shunt it aside and the breeze becomes unmistakable. You can feel small cracks in the ground. It might be your imagination, but you think you can see a tiny amount of light through them too.
