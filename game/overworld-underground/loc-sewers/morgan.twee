There's no way out, except a river running along a canal into darkness. One side is blocked by a metal grate.
<br><br>
Morgan lurches after you, slowed by legs tangled in their decaying outfit. You drop into the water and swim.
<br><br>
You swim against the gentle current and emerge in a large room. You climb onto the shore. "I'm coming <<charles>>," Morgan's voice shouts behind you. You hear a splash of water. <span class="red">You are being hunted.</span>

Morgan pulls you close, and sticks the greased bobby pin down between a gap between your neck and the collar. With a few swift motions, you feel it loosen. "Now that I've got the delicate parts exposed," Morgan lays you down. "I need to smash it!

Morgan pulls you close, and sticks the plate between your ankle and one of the shackles. It digs uncomfortably into your skin. "I can't have it moving while doing this," Morgan rambles, "and there's enough room around your leg for it to wiggle. That won't do, it needs a tight fit." <<He>> shakes the shackle to make sure it's flush against the plate, before inserting the screwdriver into the keyhole. <<He>> jams it in and out, the shackle unable to move with the plate holding it in place. "When you don't have a key, brute force does the trick! Remember it well, <<charles>>!"
<br><br>

Eventually, you hear a snap, and the shackle pops open. <<tearful>> you rise to your feet as Morgan snatches and examines the remains.

Morgan pulls you close, and wedges one end of the shears between your wrists. "These old things can't cut anymore," Morgan grumbles. "It's a shame, but that's what happens when you don't buy things with a warranty. Let that be a lesson, <<charles>>." <<He>> wiggles the blade back and forth, loosening your restraints. When they're loose enough, Morgan drops the shears and rips the ropes apart with <<his>> bare hands. <<tearful>> you rise to your feet as Morgan snatches and examines the remains.
