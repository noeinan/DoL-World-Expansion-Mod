<<endcombat>>

You are forced through the door and to your knees before a <<generate1>><<person1>><<personcomma>> who crouches and grabs your neck. <<He>> turns your head to examine one side of your face, then the other, then forces your mouth open and looks inside.

You fumble around in the dark, and find you fell on what feels like a mattress. There's also a locked metal door and a tap in the corner, but the room is otherwise bare.<br><br>
