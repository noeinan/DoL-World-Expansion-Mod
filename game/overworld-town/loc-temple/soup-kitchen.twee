The <<monks>> make it look easy, though the noise attracts more orphans. The sink is installed last. They test the tap, and it works. The <<monks>> allow themselves a quiet cheer.

They show the orphans how to work the kitchen by cooking a batch of soup. At the end of the demonstration the orphans crowd around to try the food. The rate it vanishes suggests they're impressed. Or maybe just hungry. They're eager to try cooking themselves.
