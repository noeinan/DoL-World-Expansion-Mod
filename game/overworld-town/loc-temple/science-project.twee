<<set $outside to 0>><<set $location to "temple">><<temple_effects>><<effects>>

You search the public parts of the temple walls for pink lichen, both inside and out. You're about to give up when you spot it through a window. It covers the upper half of one of the towers. There's a window up there that you should be able to reach through.
<br><br>

You walk to the tower's base and find the door locked. Many parts of the temple are closed off to the public, or even initiates.

<<generate1>><<person1>>You find a <<person>> dressed as a <<monk>> walking the halls nearby and ask permission to climb the tower. <<He>> nods.
<br><br>

<<He>> opens the way with a large bronze key, and gestures for you to enter. <<He>> follows close behind as you ascend the spiral stairs, and waits at the top while you reach out the window and peel off the pink lichen.
<br><br>

You turn to find <<him>> stood barring the stairs. "They don't let me near <<girls>> unsupervised," <<he>> pants. "No one will hear you up here. What a treat!" The <<monk>> reaches for you with both hands.

:: Temple Lichen Climb [nobr]

<<set $outside to 0>><<set $location to "temple">><<temple_effects>><<effects>>

You clamber through a window and look up the tower. The stones forming it are uneven, and many stick out. You climb, testing each stone before you use it. Some are loose. You soon reach the top. You can see much of the town and forest from here. Looking is exhilarating, but makes you feel dizzy. You peel off the lichen.

<br><br>

<<generate1>><<person1>>A hand emerges from the window and grabs your shoulder. It pulls you through head-first, leaving you sprawled on the floor inside the tower. A <<person>> dressed as a <<monk>> stands over you.
<br><br>

"What possessed you to do such a stupid, dangerous thing?" <<he>> says. "There's only one cure." <<He>> sits on the floor and pulls you over <<his>> lap.
