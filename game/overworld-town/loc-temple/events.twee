:: Temple Blessing

<<temple_effects>><<effects>>
Not knowing how to give a blessing exactly, you wave your hand over the <<persons>> head. It seems to satisfy <<him>>. "Thank you child," <<he>> says. "Lord watch over you."
<br><br>
"Could I have a blessing too?" says a <<person2>><<person>> behind you."
<br><br>
"And me!" says a <<person3>><<person>>. to the side. "I want your angel magic."
<br><br>
You spend several minutes blessing everyone who asks.

"Thank you," the initiate says, smiling. "I'm so clumsy." <<He>> pauses for a moment. Then, in a burst of daring, leans in and plants a kiss on your cheek. <<He>> scurries away before you can respond.
