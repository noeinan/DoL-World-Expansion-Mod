:: Temple Prayer Explore [nobr]

<<temple_effects>><<effects>>
You explore the previously-forbidden parts of the temple. Upstairs are living quarters for the monks and nuns. Outside, behind the temple building, is a large garden where initiates tend beds of flowers. A hedge maze trails away into the forest.
<br><br>
You find several doors painted with red crosses. Jordan warned you not to enter them, but they're all sealed shut anyway. Except for one. You find it in the back corner of the building. A <<generate1>><<person1>>stern-faced <<monk>> stands in front of it. <<His>> eyes are shut, but you feel <<him>> watching you.

"New initiate?" the <<monk>> asks without opening <<his>> eyes. <<He>> doesn't wait for you to respond. "Behind me is a prayer room. Within burns a unique incense, known to help induce visions. Occupants are locked within for at least an hour at a time, so it's a rather intense form of worship."
<br><br>

"Some consider it old-fashioned, heretical even. Others consider it the only proper way to commune with the Lord. They usually bring a <span class="gold">holy pendant</span> as protection. Regardless, access is a privilege. No one can enter while the temple and grounds are in such a state."
<br><br>

"Should you be interested," <<he>> continues "Return after helping around the temple. When either the living quarters or garden are in tip-top shape, I'll consider letting you inside."

The temple is ancient, and filled with secret passages. You know of one.

You enter a nearby hallway. You drop to your knees and search for a few moments, until you find a tiny crack along the wall. You dig your nails into the crack, and open a door, its exterior built to resemble the surrounding stone bricks.
<br><br>

You make sure the door shuts quietly behind you, then crawl up the passageway. You don't have to crawl long before you reach another door. You push it open and drop to the floor.
