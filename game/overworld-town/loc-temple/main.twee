"Wait here child," <<he>> says. "I will gather the others." <<He>> disappears through an archway. When <<he>> returns <<he>> is followed by five robed figures. They surround you as Jordan kneels in front of you, arms outstretched and holding a length of cloth. One of the <<monks>> reaches over your shoulders and takes the fabric. <<He>> wraps it around your head, blinding you.
<br><br>
"Now we must travel to the altar. Don't worry, we'll be with you at all times."
<br><br>
They guide you outside. The soft ground and muffled sound of traffic suggest they're taking you into the forest.
<br><br>
You walk for some time. They must be careful with the route they're leading you through, as you have no difficulty and your unease at walking while blind soon fades. Occasionally the group stops and you bump into whoever's in front of you. You hear someone move a branch out of way before continuing.
<br><br>
The group stops once more, but this time someone rests their hand on your arm. You hear Jordan's voice. "We're here." <<He>> lifts your hand and places it on something cold and hard. "This is an altar. You'll need to lie on top of it. First though, your clothes."

"Okay," Jordan says again. <<He>> sounds breathless. "I'm sorry, I've not done this before."

"I did it!" Jordan shouts, excited. "Did it work?"

"Not yet," the older <<monk>> responds. "Keep it up."

Jordan gets back to work, not even giving your spasms a chance to subside. "This is taking too long," says a younger voice to your right. "I'm helping." You feel a second tongue, this time on your <<nipple>>. The surprise makes you jerk away, but your bonds prevent you from moving.
<br><br>
"Good idea," the older <<monk>> says. "You. Help <<him>> out." Another tongue appears on your other nipple. Together, the teasing and licking is too much.

<<arousal 10000>>

"It's still not working," Jordan says, disheartened.
<br><br>
"Don't be silly," the older <<monk>> responds. "We just need a little something extra. Move out the way and lift up <<pher>> legs." Jordan practically climbs on top of you. Your legs are released and lifted, then pressed against your shoulders where they are tied in place once more. You couldn't be more exposed.
<br><br>
"This might be a bit awkward. No not there! That's it. Now we can both reach <<phim>>. You two, you need to help too. If this doesn't remove the taint, nothing will." They recommence their licking. This time though, two tongues assault your <<genitals 1>>.
<<if $penisexist is 1 and $player.ballsExist is true>>
	The second ranges further down, licking your testes. <<He>> even takes one into <<his>> mouth.

The final two <<monks>> don't seem confident, but they comply and start licking your arms. "Not like that. Lick <<pher>> face."
<br><br>
And so you lie there, naked and assailed by tongues on your <<genitals 1>>, <<breasts>>, and face, shaking against the bonds holding you in place. One of the <<monks>> licking your face becomes more confident and starts licking your lips. You feel your mouth open of its own accord, and <<he>> invades you with <<his>> tongue, pressing your lips together in a kiss. <<takeKissVirginity `($pronoun is "m"?"monk":"nun")`>>

You're led through the marked door and down a cramped passage. There are no lights bar the occasional torch on the wall.

After a few minutes the stone walls give way to more modern construction, and you emerge in a windowless room. <span class="red">The sight before you makes your heart sink.</span>
