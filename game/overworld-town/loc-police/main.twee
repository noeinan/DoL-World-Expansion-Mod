"Sure," <<he>> says. "It'll cost £200. You really shouldn't go putting those things on for fun. They're government property for one thing, and a bitch to get off by design."<br><br>

You go to the ruin the <<person>> mentioned, which looks like the remains of an ancient wall. You wait in the hollow interior. You don't have to wait long.<br><br>

"I'll remove your collar once we're done," <<he>> says, stooping through the arched entrance. "I think It'll make it more fun."<br><br>
