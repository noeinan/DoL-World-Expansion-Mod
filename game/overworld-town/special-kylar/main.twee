You tell Kylar about the loft at the orphanage, and ask if <<he>> has any thoughts on what to do with the space.
<br><br>

"You could hide anything up there," <<he>> says. "I-I have an idea. I could set up a lab like I have at ho-" <<he>> interrupts <<himselfcomma>> and glances around. "Like I've seen on TV. You could make pepper spray. The basic ingredients aren't hard to get, it just takes time to ferment."
<br><br>

"I know where to get the equipment," <<he>> adds. "It will be expensive though."
<br><br>

<i>Adding a lab to the orphanage will cost £20000. It will provide you with one pepper spray refill per week and help the orphans protect themselves.</i>

"Okay," Kylar says. "I'll get the stuff. Wait for me by the orphanage. I-I won't let you down."
<br><br>

You return to the orphanage without incident. You don't need to wait long. Kylar arrives, carrying two laden bags and panting. <<He>> follows you inside, though <<he>> seems to know where <<hes>> going.
<br><br>

You tug the cable, reveal the hidden staircase, and ascend. Kylar investigates each room until <<he>> finds one <<he>> deems suitable. "Good," <<he>> says, placing <<his>> bags on a creaky old table. <<He>> starts setting up the equipment while explaining how it all works.

<<generatey2>>A <<person2>><<person>> arrives to investigate at one point. You send <<him>> downstairs to gather others. More residents arrive and crowd around the door. They look nervous, but excited.
<br><br>

Kylar explains the fermentation process, and demonstrates how to prepare the chemicals and pressurise the canisters. Some of the older orphans sneer at Kylar, but <<person1>><<he>> ignores them.
<br><br>

"I wrote a list of instructions," Kylar says once you're alone. <<He>> hands you a note. "You should stick it up somewhere." <<He>> looks at <<his>> feet, as if waiting for something.
