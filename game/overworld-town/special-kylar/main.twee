"There," <<he>> says. "Are you feeling better?" You can only mumble. <<He>> scrambles over to the table, and pulls a laptop out from beneath it. You can't see the screen, but a moment later a voice emerges. Your voice.
<br><br>

"I am better," it says. Each word has a different tone, recorded in different places and stitched together.
<br><br>

Kylar beams at you. "I knew it," <<he>> says.
<br><br>

<<He>> clicks again. "I love you," says your voice.

Kylar clutches <<his>> cheeks. "I know. You tell me every day."
