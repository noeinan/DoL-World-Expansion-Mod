	You don't have to wait long. A <<personsimple>> wearing a white medical coat and carrying a clipboard emerges from an adjacent room and beckons you over.

	It's the doctor from the farm. The one who experimented on you. "Hello, I'm Doctor Harper." There's no recognition on <<his>> face. You hesitate, but enter <<his>> office and take a seat. You're in a busy hospital now, not an isolated farm.

<<else>>

	<<npc Harper>><<person1>>You don't have to wait long. Doctor Harper emerges from <<his>> office and beckons you over. You follow <<him>> in and take a seat.
