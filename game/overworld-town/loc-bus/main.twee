<<generate3>><<person3>>The bus comes to a stop at your destination and the driver climbs out of <<his>> seat. "Everyone away from <<phim>>, now." The kids start shuffling off the bus with some reluctance, lingering as long as they can. The driver, a <<person>>, throws you some towels. "I don't ever want to catch you slutting up my bus again. I'm letting the teachers know."
<br><br>
There's not much to do but cover up and leave the bus.
