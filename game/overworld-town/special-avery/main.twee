The inside of the hotel is extravagant, to say the least. You're taken aback by the many chandeliers lighting up the lobby and the large, flashy fountain right in the middle of the floor.

<</if>>
Luckily, there's a sign detailing which numbers are on which floors. Your room seems to be on the very top. You get in and press the highest number on the gold buttons.
<br><br>

The elevator ride takes longer than you expected, but when the doors open again you make your way towards the hotel room. Hesitantly, you slide the key into the lock. There's a click, and the handle is easily turned. The inside of the room is spacious and just as fancy as the rest of the hotel. It's less of a room and more of a suite, complete with a balcony with what looks like a hot tub, and a very large bed. You make your way over to the bed and sit down. There's a bounce, and you become very aware that it's much softer than the ones at the orphanage.
