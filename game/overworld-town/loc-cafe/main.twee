"I wanted to keep the buns affordable, but we've attracted interest." <<He>> holds out a holiday brochure, opened on a page that advertises the town. There's a picture of the cafe with a caption that describes the buns as "world-class."
<br><br>

"World-class!" Sam beams. "I've decided to increase the price to <span class="gold">£100</span>. We have a limited supply after all, and can't keep up with demand as it is."

Sam approaches you. "I was at a party," <<he>> says. "And I may have had one too many. Anyway, the topic of our buns came up. People were very curious about how they're made. When I told them I didn't know, that a young chef was responsible, they became even hungrier. I think a myth is building around you."
<br><br>
"Anyway," <<he>> continues. "It got me thinking. I'd like to use your image in our advertisements. Maybe redesign the front of the building. It's only fair people know who's responsible for these treats."
<br><br>
"I'm willing to increase your cut to <span class="gold">30%</span> of each bun sale," <<he>> adds, cleaning a vacated table. "I'm in talks with a professional photographer. Mull it over, then let me know what you think."

Sam approaches you, looking more serious than normal. "I've made a decision," <<he>> says. "The buns are our flagship, but people are more interested than ever in our other dishes too. Even when people know the chef is not in the building, they still queue for a chance to eat here. You've probably noticed."
<br><br>

:: Cafe Cream Bun
<<set $outside to 0>><<set $location to "cafe">><<effects>>

You take a seat and order a cream bun, advertised on the menu as using "locally sourced milk." It soon arrives.
<br><br>

It's big, and bursting with cream. It's a struggle to eat without cream squeezing onto the plate at odd angles. You don't succeed, but you don't mind. It's tasty, and leaves you feeling warm and contented.
<br><br>

You make eye contact with the <<person>>, but don't stop licking the plate. You slow your pace and exaggerate your movements, letting <<him>> see the cream on your tongue from each lick before you take it into your mouth. You half-close your eyes in feigned rapture and keep licking until your plate is perfectly clean.

You enter through the doors of the rebuilt Ocean Breeze. The main room is much wider and taller than before. You see more tables up on a second floor. They overhang the first. The rustic look is gone, replaced by an elegant deco design.
