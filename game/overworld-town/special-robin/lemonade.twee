:: Robin's Lemonade Cow [nobr]
<<effects>>

Before your hand meets the <<persons>>, someone pulls your arm back. Robin pushes you behind <<person1>><<him>>. "I need to ask you to leave," <<He>> says, handing the <<person2>><<person>> <<his>> cup.
<br><br>
"Careful, <<person1>><<if $pronoun is "m">>boy<<else>>girl<</if>>," the <<person2>><<person>> says. "Your friend is worth a lot. I'd hate to see you wind up like them."
<br><br>
Robin frowns. "I'm asking you to leave one last time before I call the police."
<br><br>
The <<person>> laughs and pours the lemonade onto the sand. "Keep the quid. Better keep an eye on your friend." <<He>> leaves.
<br><br><<person1>>
You turn to Robin, tilt your head, and give a worried moo.
<br><br>
"It's okay," Robin says. "Here." <<He>> squeezes together a mix of lemon juice, water, and sugar before handing it to you.
<br><br>
"This should make you feel better." <<Hes>> right.<<gdom>><<npcincr Robin dom 1>><<lstress>><<stress -6>>
