The two of you start to stretch and push outwards with your arms and legs as hard as you can, while matching the timing of your movements. The stomach tightens around you, spewing fluids all over you. Your clothing seems to degrade from the fluid, though you're unharmed. Robin doesn't seem to be getting squeezed or drenched the same way you are, maybe because <<he>> isn't quite in the stomach of the snake.

The more you move, the more you are massaged and soaked in fluids. You start having trouble keeping your mouth above the fluid as it fills up the stomach. You cry out in fear. Before you scream however, the squeezing motions of the stomach change and start pushing you upwards, jamming your cheek against Robin's. The two of you are squished against each other as the snake forces you out of its mouth. You and Robin are left laying in a puddle of slime as the ill snake slithers away.

Unable to escape the snake that's swallowed both of you whole, there's nothing to do but wait as you're squeezed and massaged. The viscous fluids eat away at your clothes. It isn't long until you're naked and completely covered in slime. The walls contract and rub against your <<breasts>> and <<genitals>>, and you realise with shame that your body is responding to the stimulation. The warmth and pressure on your body is having an effect, and you feel hot.

The viscous fluids seeping into the stomach aren't hurting you, but the same can't be said for what's left of your clothes.

As the squeezing around you intensifies, the fleshy valve by your face loosens and you and Robin are pushed out of the snake's gullet together, where you land in a slimy heap. As you and Robin lay panting from your oral sex session, the snake slithers away.

Having experience with this kind of situation, you recover first. You stand up and pull Robin to <<his>> feet. "Are you okay?" you ask.
<br><br>

Robin takes a while before respond, "I don't know. I still feel tingly. At least you were there for me. I don't know how I would have survived that without you."

"Would you like to drink it?" you ask. Robin looks away, lost for words. "It would make me happy." <<He>> hesitates, then reaches into the basket for an empty glass. <<He>> holds it out to you.

You lean over the glass. Robin watches with embarrassed curiosity as you squeeze your <<breasts>> in turn. Milk leaks with each squeeze. You soon fill the container.

You hand it to Robin. <<He>> stares at the white liquid. "I drink cow's milk all the time," <<he>> tells <<himself>>. "This isn't strange." <<He>> still closes <<his>> eyes as <<he>> takes a sip. "It's so sweet."
<br><br>
You have another idea. You search the basket, and find a packet of biscuits. "Dip one," you say, offering the packet.
<br><br>
Robin seems more confident eating the milky cookie. <<He>> does like sweet things. Still, <<he>> still seems uncomfortable about drinking your milk, and you don't push <<him>> further.

The rest of the picnic is uneventful. Robin seems less embarrassed by the end.
