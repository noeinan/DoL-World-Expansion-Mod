<br><br>

I've started feeling butterflies in my tummy when you talk to me, and when we hug it feels like my body is melting (In a good way). Do you want to be my <<if $player.gender is "m">>boyfriend<<else>>girlfriend<</if>>? It's okay if you don't! If you don't though, pretend you never read this note or I'll die of embarrassment.
<br><br>

Thank you for looking after me,
