<<bailey>><<person1>>You enter the main hall of the orphanage and line up with the other children. The room falls silent as Bailey storms in, eyes livid. "Listen up," <<he>> shouts. "They're cutting our funding. And I'm not sacrificing anything for you little shits." <<He>> runs a hand through <<his>> dark hair. "From now on, you're contributing. Financially."<br><br>

<<He>> unfolds paper from <<his>> jacket pocket and examines it. "<span class="pink">£100</span> should be enough to start. For the first week. I don't care how you get it. Knock on doors and ask for work. Rent yourself as a footstool. Steal it even. Just have it a week from now. Or I'll find a way to extract value from you."<br><br>

You enter Bailey's office. "I know why you're here," <<He>> says, running a hand through <<his>> dark hair. "You want me to release you from my protection, so you'll be an independent citizen. I could do that. But there's a problem. You've been living under my roof without giving anything in return. You owe me. Until you pay me back, I'm not letting you go."<br><br>

<<He>> looks at the paper on <<his>> desk and smiles. "<span class="pink">£100</span> should do. To start with. I don't care how you get it. Knock on doors and ask for work.

It walks between your legs and beholds your <<genitals>> with curiosity. It sniffs, then starts licking. It's very gentle, as if aware of the roughness of its tongue. <<if $undertype is "chastity">>Your $underclothes is no defence against its agile tongue.<</if>><<deviancy1>>

You lie back and let the cat pleasure you, stroking its ears as it does. You feel your climax build as the cat works your lewd parts.<br><br>

The cat is eager to lick up your fluid, and makes that its goal as you writhe on the grass. As your convulsions subside, the cat wanders off to find something else to do, a little fluid still on its nose.<br><br>

<<else>>
You lie back and let the cat pleasure you, stroking its ears as it does. It soon grows bored and leaves you, walking back into the bush it came from.<br><br>
