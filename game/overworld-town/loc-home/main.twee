There’s nothing much you can do but watch as someone climbs through. 
		<br><br>

		Whitney stands just inside your bedroom window, a devilish smirk on <<his>> face, carrying a small drawstring gym bag over their shoulder. A sturdy leather collar and thick chain leash hang from <<his>> side. Noticing Robin asleep in your bed behind you, <<he>> quickly approaches until you’re nearly falling back onto the mattress. One hand reaches up to grab you by the hair, while <<his>> other firmly grips your ass. They lean in to growl directly into your ear.

		You’re trying your best to sleep, shifting around uncomfortably in bed, when you become aware of a quiet rattling noise coming from your window. you can't help but hide under the bed, too scared to look. 
		<br><br>

		Suddenly, you feel a pair of hands wrap around your ankles, and you’re dragged out from under the bed, letting out a short scream before it’s cut off by the stranger holding your mouth shut. They have you pinned to the floor, and you struggle weakly against their weight, still too afraid to look at them.
		<br><br>

		“Whoa, whoa, hey. I’m not going to hurt you. It’s me. Shh… shh.” comes a voice, which you don’t immediately recognize, but the soft tone has you relax your posture and peak one eye open. Eventually, you realize who it is. Whitney. 
		<br><br>

		“Fuck, you look like shit. C’mon, get up and sit on the bed.” <<he>> commands, helping pull you up off the floor and guiding you back to the mattress. “I wanted to take you out for a late night walk, actually. Strip, put on this collar, and follow close." <<he>> continues, although <<he>> sounds as if <<he>>'s reconsidering his plans after seeing you so scared.

		<br><br>

		“Wakey wakey, pet.” <<he>> growls, slowly advancing towards you. Now that you’re fully awake, you notice that <<he>>'s brought something with <<him>>. A sturdy leather collar and thick chain leash hang from <<his>> side. Displeased your eyes were taken off <<him>>, a firm hand quickly cups underneath your chin and tilts your head up to look at <<him>>.

/*Not in yet*/

You play a fighting game. You struggle to keep up with the move list.

--

You're playing a pixelated war game. Soldiers move across the battlefield in an orderly manner. You're all set for the bloodshed to come as you bark your orders with buttons.

--

A game set in medieval times beckons you with adventure. You spend your time cutting down trees instead.

--

You're astonished at the variety of games that have been purchased on the device. You speculate that Robin didn't want you to get bored or was unaware of what you liked.

--


You play a sports game. One of the players on your team suffers a career-ending injury.

--

You bash and claw at your opponents in a fighting game, leaving you the victor in a tournament ladder.

--

A horror game pits you against yourself. You do well to keep your sanity in an abandoned city.

--

An overarching RPG leaves you a bit confused. You ponder whether you're making the correct choices with an odd cast of characters.

--


An arcade-style hack and slash occupy your time. An entire horde of orcs is no match for your divine strength loaned to you by the Gods.

--

In a fighting game, you frustratingly try to learn a decent combo on a character. It takes some time, but you think you've got it figured out.

--

A first-person shooter's story leaves you pondering about your character's actions. You ignore the implications and continue charging through the arenas.

--

You find an easter egg in one of your games. The developer thanks you for playing.

No soldier is a match for your unstoppable onslaught. Cheater.

	and headsets.

"Good-good. Okay. Look if you know about me, and Landry knows about me, then it's no longer safe. Word's out and spreading. Just a matter of time before Bailey hears something.
That would be bad. I need to disappear. I'll help you later. But I need you now. Need you to do three things."
<br>
You nod. A small USB device is shoved into your hand.
<br><br>
"One. There's a computer in Bailey's office. Ancient. Full of holes. It's where all the orphan records are. Easy pickings. Plug this device into it.
Computer has to be on and logged in - probably need to catch Bailey using it. This will let me in so I can delete all records of myself.
<br>
"Two. Get into Leighton's office. At the school. There's a safebox under the desk. SD memory cards. Lots of them. Pictures of things. Things Leighton does to naive people who don't know better.
People like I was. Leighton can not keep those. I don't allow it. So steal them. You'll have to pick the lock. Don't get caught.
<br>
"Three. Put in a good word with Landry. I can make Landry money. Insane money. And I need a place to lay low. So it's win-win: Landry hides me - I make Landry very rich.
Bailey never finds me. So talk to Landry. BUT. Do the other stuff first. That's more urgent."
<br><br>
"Okay," you say.
<br>
"Good-good. Do this for me, I'll look out for you. I mean... you'll probably never see me again. But I will. Promise. Anyway get to it."

"Uh..."
<br>
"What? Get to it!"
<br>
You wave a hand to indicate your nudity.
<br>
"Oh, wow," the eyes widen. "Sorry."

The kid grabs the clothes basket, passes it over.

"Sorry. Forgot. You... uh, look good."
