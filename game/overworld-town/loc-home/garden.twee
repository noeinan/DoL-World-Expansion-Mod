You shuffle out from beneath the bush and take cover behind a plant pot. You stand up, lifting the pot as you so that the flowers continue to protect you. You walk along the side of the garden, hoping no one thinks anything is odd. The children don't look twice at you.<br><br>

You're half way there when the bottom of the pot gives way, spilling the contents and causing the rest of the pot to collapse. You find yourself stood out in the open with your <<lewdness>> displayed. One of the children averts their eyes, but most stare at you.
