	"The money," Bailey responds, impatient.
	<br>
	"Ah. Here." There's a rustle to one side, then someone tugs on your leash, pulling you forward.
	<br>
	"A pleasure," Bailey says, already walking away.
	<br><br>

	"Watch the step," says the unfamiliar voice. Whatever you've stepped onto is rumbling. "Sit." You fumble around your knees, and find what feels like a bench. You sit, then hear the slam of doors, and a few moment later you lurch as the floor moves beneath you. You're in a vehicle.
