You feel light-headed as you regain consciousness. Your vision clears, and you find yourself facing out a window onto the High Street. You cannot move an inch, but you're stood upright. You feel straps against your skin, they must be holding you steady. They're also contorting your limbs into a specific pose; your hands are resting on your hips and your head is cocked to one side.
<br><br>

Once your bewilderment subsides, you notice you are wearing nothing but a string bikini. The implication suddenly dawns on you when a young blond woman stops in front of the window and stares. You feel blood rush to your face at the humiliation, but she moves on without a flicker of realisation on her face.
<br><br>

<<link [[Next|Abduction Shop]]>><<pass 1 hour>><<trauma 9>><</link>>

<<elseif $phase is 1>>

An hour passes without event. More people look at you through the window but none realise you aren't a mannequin. Most people just pass you by without a glance.
<br><br>

You feel less groggy now, and can even twitch a bit. You'll regain control of your body soon, but that still leaves the straps.
<br><br>

Your musing is interrupted by a gentle prod on your backside. A <<person1>><<person>> walks in front of you. <<His>> eyes explore up and down your body, lingering on your bikini bottoms. <<He>> reaches a hand out.
<br><br>

<<elseif $phase is 2>>

You can barely murmur, but it's enough. Startled, the <<person>> cries out and runs away. A moment later you hear another voice<<person2>> laugh. "A mannequin spoke?" <<he>> says. "You have an overactive imagination." A pair of hands clasp round your shoulders and spin you to face the inside of the shop. You see the <<person1>><<person>> along with a <<person2>><<person>> watching you.
<br><br>

"Hey sexy doll," the <<person>> prods your waist. Prods a little too hard; the force upsets your balance and you fall to the ground. The <<person1>><<person>> bursts into laughter.
<br><br>

Looking somewhat sheepish, the <<person2>><<person>> picks you up and tries to put you back into position. It's not an easy job to get you stable. Thinking you an object, <<he>> callously manhandles you, gripping you by whichever part of your body <<he>> thinks will help until <<he>> gets you to stay upright.

With your <<genitals>> exposed for all to see, <<he>> recommences <<his>> investigation into your private area. Before <<he>> becomes too confident a voice calls out, "What are you doing to that mannequin," it says. "You're such a pervert." Startled, the <<person>> ceases <<his>> adventure and moves away from you.

<br><br>

After two hours you feel your focus has returned, but the tight straps and forced position have made you physically sore. You are considering trying to loosen your bonds when you are lifted from behind and carried into a back room.

True to <<his>> word, there's £15 on the table, along with a bottle of water, a muffin with some sort of fruit in it, and the bottoms that were stripped from you.
