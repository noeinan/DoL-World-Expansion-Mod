/*
<<generate1>><<person1>>
You approach the van, and peer inside. A rush of footsteps is all the warning you're given. A pair of arms shove you forward.
<br><br>

You tumble onto the van floor. You turn just in time to see a <<person>> slam the doors shut.
<br><br>

You try to open the doors, but they're locked. You look around, but see no other way out. The van rumbles into motion.
<br><br>

<<link [[Next|Street Van Journey]]>><</link>>

*/

You approach the van. A girl in a white dress tinkers at the engine. She looks up as you approach, and pulls her long brown hair away from her eyes.
<br><br>
"Hi there," she says. "No need to take this old thing to cow jail anymore. There are lots of other ways there now, so it's being repurposed. Come back when there's another new area, and it might take you there instead."
<br><br>
A tall blonde girl in a crisp black outfit walks around the bonnet, and slashes one of the tires. The other girl looks bemused.
