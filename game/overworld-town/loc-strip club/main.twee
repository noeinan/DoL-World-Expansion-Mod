You are led to the back of the club, then up a flight of stairs. A wooden door sits open at the top. The bouncer knocks twice and motions you through.

You enter what looks like a personal office. Shelves overflowing with books line the walls. There's a desk on the far side of the room. More books lay open on top of one another, a few lie on the ground at its base. Instead of a wall, one side of the room has a large window overlooking the club below. A <<if $pronoun is "m">>man<<else>>woman<</if>> stands facing away from you, looking for something on one of the shelves.

"Any tips you get are yours to keep, but if it's serious money you're after you'll want to sell private dances to patrons. We provide rooms for such a purpose. What happens in there, and how much it will cost them, is between you and your client. Officially there's not supposed to be any physical contact, so be discreet. We take an eighty percent cut of anything you earn in a private room. That might seem high, but trust me, it isn't."
