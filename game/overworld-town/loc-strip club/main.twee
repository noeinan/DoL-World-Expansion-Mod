You enter what looks like a personal office. Shelves overflowing with books line the walls. There's a desk on the far side of the room. More books lay open on top of one another, a few lie on the ground at its base. Instead of a wall, one side of the room has a large window overlooking the club below. A <<personsimple>> stands facing away from you, looking for something on one of the shelves.

We take an eighty percent cut of anything you earn in a private room. That might seem high, but trust me, it isn't."
