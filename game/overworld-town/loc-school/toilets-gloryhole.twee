:: School Gloryhole Start
<!-- DONE If you stay late, people quit showing up, so you have to wait (10 min at time, until PC gives up and leaves) -->
<!-- DONE Getting customers is based on how much you're charging and how "good" the PC is (fame/skill/something) If you charge too much no one shows up so you have to spend more time waiting than earning. 10 min time blocks.-->
<!-- DONE Random chance that janitor kicks you+queue out while this is going on, with sub-chance that he/she takes advantage of PC. -->
<!-- DONE Make janitor outcome based on fame / delinquency -->
<!-- SKIPPED Would make sense that the longer the queue, the more likely the janitor comes and kicks everyone out -->
<!-- DONE With high history perhaps you know other ways out that the janitor can't get to.
<!-- DONE Save janitor NPC for re-use -->
<!-- SKIPPED Sneaking out of the gloryhole should involve some more risk / complexity...? -->
