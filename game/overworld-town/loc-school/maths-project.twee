	You sit back and admire your work. You feel a strange heat just beneath your skin. It grows and spreads through your body, concentrated on your loins. Lewd fantasies force themselves into your mind. Within moments, your cheeks are flushed and you find yourself squirming with desire. That dose must have been contaminated by a concentrated aphrodisiac.

	Your hands wander between your legs in an instinctive attempt to satisfy your burning desire. But the stimulation from touching yourself is too strong to bear. The pleasure shoots through you, painfully intense. Your hands recoil, and your whole body convulses as your vision whites out. The aftershocks leave you trembling. There's no way you'll be able to use your hands to comfort yourself.
	<br><br>
	You consider leaving your room for some fresh air. But your mind is so overwhelmed by desire. You can only imagine what will happen when someone finds you in your defenceless state.

Dark, threatening shapes shift around you as you stumble forward in search of something familiar to cling to. Grotesque creatures with giant eyes and countless thrashing tongues watch you from afar, gibbering in guttural sounds that echo across the landscape. The floor begins to liquefy, and you struggle to move through it as you sink to your ankles, then your knees, then your waist. Finally, it gives way all at once and you find yourself falling, tumbling end-over-end through a black void.

You grasp the hem of your $worn.lower.name with both hands as Whitney and <<his>> friends tug. You prevent them from revealing your <span class="pink"><<undies>></span> to the audience, but the fabric covering you becomes even tighter.
<br><br>

The audience is alive with excitement. Some look away, but most stare in astonishment, or pull phones from their pockets. Leighton sits on the edge of <<endevent>><<npc Leighton>><<person1>><<his>> seat. <<endevent>><<npc River>><<person1>>River remains completely still, hands covering <<his>> eyes.
<br><br>

The photographer now darts around in front of the stage, taking pictures of the struggle from every angle. Perhaps waiting for the moment you're exposed in front of everyone.
<br><br>
<<endevent>><<npc Whitney>><<person1>>
Whitney and friends stop pulling for a moment, but only to reposition in the aisle so they can put their backs into it. The force almost forces you to the ground.
<br><br>

You feel a slackness as one of the wires snaps, soon followed by the others. Whitney and <<his>> friends fall backwards. You almost fall over yourself. You pull your $worn.lower.name back where it belongs. You spend a few moments removing the hooks.
<br><br>

<<endevent>><<npc Leighton>><<person1>>"That's enough," Leighton says. "Time to wrap up."

You keep your skirt held down with one hand and continue with the presentation. Whitney's friends join in the tugging. Your $worn.lower.name becomes tighter, until just a finger of fabric protects your <<genitals>> from the audience.
<br><br>

Leighton and most of the crowd sit on the edge of their seats. <<endevent>><<npc River>><<person1>>River keeps <<his>> eyes covered, but the guests watch with horrified expressions. With a final tug, your $worn.lower.name <<lowerplural>> torn free from your grip, <span class="pink">exposing you to the crowd.</span>

Gasps and laughter fill the hall. Some look away, but most stare in astonishment, or pull phones from their pockets. River might have fainted.
