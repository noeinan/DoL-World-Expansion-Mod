You mock the teacher. "Sorry for interrupting <<sir>>. I just wanted to see you in
<<if $pronoun is "f">>that tight swimsuit<<else>>those tight shorts<</if>>." A few of the students laugh, others start blushing.
<br><br>

Mason also blushes. "I-I'll pretend I didn't hear that." <<He>> points to the changing rooms, before quickly looking away from you.

There's no way you're doing this. You leave the pool, clothes on and dignity intact, but refusing a teacher will have consequences.
