The ruler is not so wide so slowly but surely it starts sliding even deeper. You can feel your cervix stretching and opening up as it accepts the foreign object.

After a grunt from you and one final push the ruler is completely inside of you now, your fingers enter your vagina pushing it even deeper just to show everyone you could still do more if you wanted to.
