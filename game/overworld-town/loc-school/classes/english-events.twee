You tell Doren that you've been attacked numerous times, and that you don't feel able to cope. Saying it out loud makes you feel dizzy. You don't go into details, but make it clear how trapped you feel.
<br><br>
You realise you're sat on the floor, being held up by Doren's arm. You don't remember falling. "It's okay <<lass>>, I've got you." <<He>> pulls a phone out of <<his>> pocket and calls someone. "Hello? Yes. I need someone to cover my class. Yes, it's an emergency. No. Goodbye." <<He>> puts the phone away.

<br><br>
<<generate3>><<person3>>A <<person>> sits at the desk, wearing an officer's uniform. <<He>> doesn't glance up as you enter. Doren knocks on the surface, hard enough that a pencil rolls onto the floor. <<person1>>"We've got a crime to report," <<he>> says. "Maybe several."
<br><br>
The officer looks up. "There's a queue," <<person3>><<he>> says.
<br><br>
Doren looks around the empty room. "Doesn't look like a queue to me."
<br><br>
"A backlog then," the officer replies. "We can't help you for three years."
<br><br>
"Three years!?" Doren slams <<person1>><<his>> fist into the desk, knocking over a mug this time. "This <<girl>> was ra..." <<he>> catches <<himself>>. "<<pShe>> was attacked. More than once. You're telling me you can't do anything?"
<br><br>
"We can. In three years." <<person3>><<He>> types something into <<his>> computer. "We already have you on record. We'll contact you when we're ready to take your report. Have a nice day."
