You're reading "Raul and Janet".

<br><br>
The book tells the story of two lovers from the seventeenth century. Raul is the son of a poor tailor, but from the honest work he prefers night trips in search of adventures. Janet is a young polite girl from a wealthy family and daughter of local baron and ruler of the city. Despite the differences between them they fall in love with each other but Janet's father is against their acquaintances, stating that the street boy is not the right fiancée for his daughter. One day, Raul convinces his beloved to run away together.
<br><br>
It turns out eventually that the baron's fears were real. When Janet's father orders him to leave his daughter alone, the boy brutally kills him, burns the court and returns to a girl who does not know what happened. They make love the same night.
<br><br>
With each act, the book becomes darker and scarier. Every time you read it you have a view of innocent pure girl in white dress and a dangerous and lustful lad in front of your eyes. You feel a mix of jealousy, lust and anger. And you like it.
<br><br>

A duel begins between Raul and William. Raul has the upper hand, but the moment he is about to kill William, Janet stabs him with a dagger.
<br><br>
He gets furious, strikes her back, accidentally piercing her with a sword. He is shocked realising what just happened. William uses the opportunity and finishes his opponent with his blade.
<br><br>
The history ends with both would-be lovers looking into one another's eyes for the last time, then the darkness overwhelms them.

You slowly close the book. You feel moved, but relaxed.
