<<widget "mathsphone">>

They compare the pictures they've taken. Two of them push their phones in front of you.
<br><br>

<<if $mathsab1 is "smile">>
The first picture shows you smiling, with your hands making peace signs. If you didn't know better, you wouldn't realise the picture was taken under duress.
<<elseif $mathsab1 is "frown">>
The first picture shows you frowning, and making offensive gestures at the camera with your hands.
<<elseif $mathsab1 is "cover">>
The first picture shows you covering your face. You don't think anyone could tell it was you.
<<elseif $mathsab1 is "tearsmile">>
The first picture shows you smiling, with your hands making peace signs. Tears wet your face, and the smile is far from genuine.
<<elseif $mathsab1 is "tearfrown">>
The first picture shows you frowning, tearful and angry. You're making offensive gestures at the camera with your hands.
<<elseif $mathsab1 is "tearcover">>
The first picture shows you covering your face. Tears run down from beneath your hands.
<</if>>
You look far more dishevelled in the second, taken some time later. You're coated in something slick and glistening.
<<if $mathsab2 is "smile">>
Your face is smiling, but there's something strange about the look in your eyes.
<<elseif $mathsab2 is "frown">>
Your face is angry, defiant.
<<elseif $mathsab2 is "cover">>
Your face is covered.
<<elseif $mathsab2 is "tearsmile">>
Your face is smiling, but the tears betray what's really happening.
<<elseif $mathsab2 is "tearfrown">>
Your face is tearful, but angry and defiant.
<<elseif $mathsab2 is "tearcover">>
Your face is covered, but the tears are unmistakable.
