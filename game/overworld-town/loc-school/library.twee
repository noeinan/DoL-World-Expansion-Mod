/*indev - Extra library description*/
A large desk sits near the back of the library, with a sign reading "Book Rental + Clothing" hanging above.
<br>
There are several shelves with typical academic literature. You see books on engineering, biology, social sciences and language learning. Everything that is useful in catching up.
<br>
Next to it is a small basket with returned and not yet sorted books.
