			hint:`"For a jewellery case," Winter says while gesturing at an empty pedestal. "People around here used <<printTo>> keep their valuables in ornate boxes, sculpted of the finest ivory and hewn from wood found right outside town. I'd imagine they don't look like anything you'd find today."<br><br> <<He>> turns away. "If you had paid attention in my class, you might know what <<printTo>> look for."`,
			museum:"The Ivory Box sits on a pedestal.",
			name:"Waterlogged Ivory Box"
		},
		"antiquesilverring":{
			hint:`"For a simple silver band," Winter says while gesturing at an empty pedestal. "Silver was common in jewellery like this. Hardy enough <<printTo>> outlive its owner, so it was often buried with them."<br><br><<He>> turns away. "Silver is even known <<printTo>> hold up well underwater, compared <<printTo>> most other metals."`,
			museum:"The Worn Silver Ring sits on a red pillow on top of a pedestal.",
			name:"Worn Silver Ring"
		},
		"antiquegoldnecklace":{
			hint:`"For a gold necklace. This would be quite the rare find," Winter says while gesturing at an empty pedestal. "Usually worn by people of a higher class."<br><br><<He>> turns away. "Did you know that Gold never rusts? You could keep it submerged until the end of time."`,
			museum:"The Ornate Gold Necklace sits on a red pillow on top of a pedestal.",
			name:"Ornate Gold Necklace"
		},
		"antiqueivorynecklace":{
			hint:`"I'm not certain that this one exists," Winter says while gesturing at an empty pedestal. "There's an old poem mentioning something like it. 'Great beast's tusks, carved anew. Starlight sapphire, midnight blue. Cut <<printTo>> perfection, lustre and hue. Immaculate vanity, known by the few. Locked away forever, the writhing ensue. Locked away forever, in lake creature's slew. Cast away forever, the waves <<printTo>> chew. Cast away forever, <<printTo>> be found by...'" <<he>> turns on the spot, flicking you on the nose. "You."<br><br><<He>> turns away. "You would most likely find something like this surrounded by lesser jewellery. Good luck."`,
			museum:"A spot for the Immaculate Ivory Necklace is looking bare as it was taken away at some point.",
			name:"Immaculate Ivory Necklace"
		},
		"antiquecrystal":{
			hint:`"I received a call about the object meant for this one," Winter says while gesturing at an empty pedestal. "A small pinkish crystal with an engraving. How unusual."<br><br><<He>> turns away. "Whoever called about it mentioned losing something down a drainage pipe."`,
			museum:"The Arousing Crystal sits on a red pillow on top of a pedestal.",
			name:"Arousing Crystal"
		},
		"antiquehorn":{
			hint:`"For a hunting trophy of some kind," Winter says while gesturing at an empty pedestal. "A hollowed out horn. Hunters in the old town loved their trophies."<br><br><<He>> turns away. "Sadly, most remains of the old town are buried."`,
			museum:"The Hunting Horn sits on a red pillow on top of a pedestal.",
			name:"Hunting Horn"
		},
		"antiquewatch":{
			hint:`"For old clockwork, most likely non-functional," Winter says while gesturing at an empty pedestal. "You'd be surprised how valuable a simple wristwatch could be."<br><br><<He>> turns away. "Sometimes they were even locked in specialised safe boxes with a matching timer."`,
			museum:"The Old Watch sits in a specially prepared case on top of a pedestal.",
			name:"Old Watch"

		"antiquedildo":{
			hint:`"Let's call this one a medical aid," Winter says while gesturing at an empty pedestal. "Beyond obsolete. Often unsanitary."<br><br><<He>> turns away. "Speaking of unsanitary, I heard that someone managed <<printTo>> stumble into the old sewers."`,
			museum:"The Odd Medical Aid sits on a pedestal.",
			name:"Odd Medical Aid"
		},
		"antiquecandlestick":{
			hint:`"For a humble candle, turned into a symbol of power for a house of nobles," Winter says while gesturing at an empty pedestal. "With how many were made, there must be some still around."<br><br><<He>> turns away. "The old sewers are the most likely place <<printTo>> find one."`,
			museum:"The Noble Candle Stick sits in a mockup of a sconce hanging from the wall.",
			name:"Noble Candle Stick"
		},
		"antiqueforestarrow":{
			hint:`"For an Arrowhead. A very common find," Winter says while gesturing at an empty pedestal. "Little more than a curiosity, but having one <<printTo>> display would be valued nonetheless."<br><br><<He>> turns away. "They're strewn about everwhere just outside of town."`,
			museum:"The Mossy Forest Arrow sits on a green pillow on top of a pedestal.",
			name:"Mossy Forest Arrow"
		},
		"antiqueforestdagger":{
			hint:`"For an old weapon," Winter says while gesturing at an empty pedestal. "Most likely buried under a few meters of dirt, and a good distance away from town."<br><br><<He>> turns away. "Watch where you step out there, just in case."`,
			museum:"The Rusted Forest Dagger sits on a green pillow on top of a pedestal.",
			name:"Rusted Forest Dagger"
		},
		"antiqueforestgem":{
			hint:`"Someone from the same class as you reported this one <<printTo>> me," Winter says while gesturing at an empty pedestal. "They spun a tale of a verdant gemstone with shifting patterns that made them feel unnaturally calm. If it is indeed real, there's a decent reward for bringing it <<printTo>> me."<br><br><<He>> turns away. "They used <<printTo>> mine gems similar in description <<printTo>> this deep in the forest."`,
			museum:"The Pulsing Forest Gem sits on a green pillow on top of a pedestal.",
			name:"Pulsing Forest Gem"
		},
		"antiquesilverbrooch":{
			hint:`"I'm at a loss," Winter says while gesturing at an empty pedestal. "For a brooch made from sterling silver. Something like this should be more common. The design was popular just a few decades ago."<br><br><<He>> turns away. "It's likely hidden away in a loft somewhere. Someone with a rebellious streak is bound <<printTo>> find one digging through their parents' old belongings eventually."`,
			museum:"The Silver Brooch sits on a pedestal.",
			name:"Silver Brooch"
		},
		"antiquetrashcup":{
			hint:`"Such a shame," Winter says while gesturing at an empty pedestal. "For a simple drinking cup. These were common barely a century ago. No one thinks <<printTo>> keep them around."<br><br><<He>> turns away. "Most people toss them away like common rubbish."`,
			museum:"The Discarded Cup sits on a pedestal.",
			name:"Discarded Cup"
		},
		"antiquetrashburner":{
			hint:`"For an incense burner used in religious ceremonies," Winter says while gesturing at an empty pedestal. "The temple still has some laying around. Don't think you can just take one, though."<br><br><<He>> turns away. "They threw away a batch of these not too long ago. I suspect they burn through after too much use."`,
			museum:"The Incense Burner sits on a pedestal. It seems <<printTo>> have been cleaned and restored recently.",
			name:"Incense Burner"
		},
		"antiquebrassstatuette":{
			hint:`"For an exotic statuette, cast in brass. These particular ones were never produced here," Winter says while gesturing at an empty pedestal. "Truly ancient. It might have spiritual significance <<printTo>> whoever brought it here."<br><br><<He>> turns away. "I'm sure you could find something like this if you dug through enough religious areas."`,
			museum:"The Forgotten Brass Statuette sits on a pedestal.",
			name:"Forgotten Brass Statuette"
		},
		"antiquegoldchastitybelt":{
			hint:`"I have a particular interest in this one," Winter says while gesturing at an empty pedestal. "Priestesses of old would wear special... protection, for ceremonies. Higher quality than what the temple gives out today. I imagine it could be used for more than just protection, however."<br><br><<He>> turns away. "The word 'Gilded' comes up in the translation multiple times. Reminds me of a tale of tainted religious objects being cleansed in a holy lake."`,
			museum:"The Golden Chastity Belt is wrapped around a feminine mannequin.",
			name:"Golden Chastity Belt"
