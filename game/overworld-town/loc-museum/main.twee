<<else>>
"I've thought about it," you say. "I'd like to help demonstrate the wooden horse."
<</if>>
<br><br>
Winter smiles. "I'm glad to hear it," <<he>> says. <<He>> places the pot in a surer spot and disappears into a back room. When <<he>> emerges <<he>> holds a bundle of taut rags.
<br><br>
"This is the outfit." <<He>> holds the cloth out so you can see. They still just look like rags. You're not sure how you could wear them. Or how much they would cover. "They're sturdier than they look. Get dressed and I'll get the camera. We'll need to advertise. A picture of you looking the part should suffice."
<br><br>
Winter disappears once more. You undress and wrap one rag around your waist, where it almost feels like a skirt. The other you wrap around your chest. It's enough to cover your <<breastsstop>>
<br><br>
<<He>> returns with the camera, and smiles. "Pefect. Try to look scared." <<He>> takes a picture, but then pauses. "Would you mind sitting on the horse? We don't need to bother with the binds or anything, but I think that might work better."
<br><br>
You climb atop the wooden horse and ease yourself down. The hard wood pushes between your <<if $vaginaexist is 1>>labia<<else>>testes<</if>>. You try to push your short, taut skirt between your legs for protection, but it's no use. You're not going to be able to sit on this properly without discomfort.
<br><br>
Winter takes a final picture. <<He>> seems satisfied. "Thank you. This should do the trick." <<He>> leaves you to get dressed.

You wear the rags, as taut and revealing as you remember. You wonder how you look. You'll soon have an audience.<<exhibitionism1>>
Winter returns. <<He>> holds something at <<his>> side. "Perfect." <<He>> pauses. "I'd like to propose something. I don't want you to feel pressured." <<He>> holds the object out in front of you. It's a whip. "There are degrees of authenticity. If it's okay with you, I'd like to weigh you down as they would have in the past. And whip you. Not too hard, but enough to impress."

"Ladies and gentlemen," Winter begins. <<He>> stands on a raised platform beside the horse, addressing an audience of around fifty people. "Our town has a rich history.

The audience is enraptured by the spectacle. You feel their eyes on your barely-covered <<genitalsstop>> "Of course, humiliation was part of the punishment." <<He>> throws open a chest at <<his>> feet, and reaches in. <<He>> pulls out a metal weight.

It was uncomfortable before, but now it hurts. <<He>> walks around the horse and repeats the process. Your eyes water.<<pain 20>>

<<winter>><<person1>>Winter runs <<his>> finger over the mouthpiece, and recoils as if hurt. <<His>> face shows no sign of pain. "A hunting trophy from abroad," <<he>> says. "They had it made into an instrument. Not what I would have done."
