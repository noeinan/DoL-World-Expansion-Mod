Winter smiles. "I'm glad to hear it," <<he>> says. <<He>> places the pot in a surer spot and disappears into a back room. When <<he>> emerges <<he>> holds a bundle of taut rags.
<br><br>

"This is the outfit." <<He>> holds the cloth out so you can see. They still just look like rags. You're not sure how you could wear them. Or how much they would cover. "They're sturdier than they look. Get dressed and I'll get the camera. We'll need to advertise. A picture of you looking the part should suffice."
<br><br>

Winter disappears once more. You undress and wrap one rag around your waist, where it almost feels like a skirt. The other you wrap around your chest. It's enough to cover your <<breastsstop>>
<br><br>

<<He>> returns with the camera, and smiles. "Perfect. Try to look scared." <<He>> takes a picture, but then pauses. "Would you mind sitting on the horse? We don't need to bother with the binds or anything, but I think that might work better."
<br><br>

You climb atop the wooden horse and ease yourself down. The hard wood pushes between your <<if $vaginaexist is 1>>labia<<else>>testes<</if>>. You try to push your short, taut skirt between your legs for protection, but it's no use. You're not going to be able to sit on this properly without discomfort.

"Just a few adjustments," the <<person>> says to Winter. "Then we'll be set."

Winter claps <<his>> hands together and turns to you. "Your role is to sit in the chair as it is dunked into the river. I'll operate the crane and talk the audience through the history of the device.

"You'll be tied down," <<he>> continues. "But we don't need to submerge you completely. Expect to get wet. I have a suitable garment in mind, so you don't need to worry about that."

You return to the museum with Winter. <<He>> seems excited.

Winter leads you outside, down the small side road, and into the park. You hear voices up ahead as you approach the river. Winter stops you beside the toilets, and pushes a bundle of rags into your hands. "We don't want to get your clothes wet. I'll look after them until you're done."
<br><br>

You enter the toilets and change into the rags. They're tight and revealing. You wonder how you look. You'll soon have an audience.

You step outside and hand your clothes to Winter. "Very good," <<he>> says. "One more thing. I don't want you to feel any pressure to accept, but I have a suggestion." <<He>> rummages in <<his>> jacket pocket.

"The demonstration will be more authentic if I submerge you completely," Winter says, producing a small device dominated by a green button. "I'll give you this waterproof buzzer, which will notify me the instant you want the demonstration to stop." <<He>> presses the button, and <<his>> pocket vibrates. "You'll be underwater, and this will be your only way to communicate with me."
<br><br>

"Again, I must stress that you should feel no pressure to accept," <<he>> adds. "It would help sell the scene and drum up interest, but I know I'm asking a lot."

Winter nods, and hands you the green buzzer. <<He>> stands on <<his>> toes to peer above a hedge. "Everyone's ready," <<he>> says. "We've got a crowd waiting. Come."
<br><br>
You follow Winter around the hedge. There's a large crowd, maybe a hundred people, stood around the ducking stool. They look at Winter, and at you, eager to begin.
<br><br>

"Ladies and gentlemen," Winter begins, gesturing for you to take a seat. "Today we are here to witness the punishment of this rapscallion." <<He>> pulls the straps over you, and binds you down tight. "A con artist, who swindled many good citizens. Now <<pshe>> faces justice."
<br><br>

Winter walks to the other end of the crane, and lifts you into the air. <<He>> continues to talk about the ducking stool as <<he>> pushes you over the river. The water rushes beneath you.

Winter pulls a lever, and you descend toward the water below. It splashes agaisnt your feet, then your legs, then up to your abdomen and chest. It's cold. You wonder how long the demonstration will last.
<br><br>

"Such a punishment was not usually fatal," Winter says, pulling the lever in the other direction. You begin to rise. "Public humiliation was the primary goal." The audience murmur amongst themselves. With a flash of panic, you look down to make sure the rags have not soaked to transparency. Before you can get a good look, Winter plunges you into the river once more, this time up to your neck.
<br><br>

With a final push of the lever, the chair lowers the rest of the way, submerging you.

Winter smiles. "It wouldn't always end there," <<he>> says. "The particularly dastardly had yet more in store for them." <<He>> lifts <<his>> whip and holds it in front of the audience. Then, without a word, <<he>> steps behind you.
<br><br>

You scream as the whip lashes against your skin. Again and again. The audience gapes at the spectacle.

It only takes Winter a moment to remove the straps tying the weights to your legs. <<He>> helps you off the horse and holds your hand for a moment. Once sure you're okay, <<he>> turns to the audience.
<br><br>

"That ends our demonstration. Thank you for attending. We hope you found it informative, and we invite you to appreciate the many other antiques we have on display. Last but not least, let's have a round of applause for our star." <<He>> gestures at you. The audience applaud politely, though many look like they wish it had gone further.
<br><br>

"You did very well," Winter says once you're back in the small room. "I'm blessed to have your assistance. Thank you. I'd like to hold another demonstration next weekend if it suits you." <<He>> peeks around the door. "I think we've earned some new interest." <<He>> leaves you to get dressed.
<br><br>

Despite the pain, you feel a strong catharsis.<<trauma -12>>

Winter doesn't stop. Again and again <<he>> lashes at your flesh. Some of the audience look disturbed, others shocked, and some are clearly enjoying it.
<br><br>

You feel like you're about to pass out, but then Winter stops. <<He>> walks in front of you, panting. "That ends our demonstration," <<he>> says. "Thank you for attending. We hope you found it informative, and we invite you to appreciate the many other antiques we have on display. Last but not least, let's have a round of applause for our star." <<He>> gestures at you. The audience applaud. Some are crying themselves.
<br><br>

"You did very well," Winter says once you're back in the small room. "Let me see your back." You turn and feel <<him>> trace a finger over you skin. "I'm blessed to have your assistance," <<he>> says as <<he>> applies something soothing. "Thank you. I'd like to hold another demonstration next weekend if it suits you." <<He>> peeks around the door. "I think we've earned some new interest." <<He>> leaves you to get dressed.

Winter nods. <<He>> peeks around the door. "Everyone's in. It's time. Wait for you cue." <<He>> returns to the museum proper.
<br><br>

"Ladies and gentlemen," Winter begins. <<He>> stands on a raised platform beside the horse, addressing an audience of around fifty people. "Our town has a rich history. Of great deeds and heroism yes, but also of tragedy and brutality. Take this <<girlcomma>>" <<He>> gestures at the door, and you <<nervously>> emerge into the museum. A <<person2>><<person>> stands closest to you. <<He>> licks <<his>> lips.
<br><br>

<<person1>>"Caught stealing bread for <<pher>> starving sibling," Winter continues. "<<pShe>> must now face the lord's justice." You climb atop the horse and ease yourself down. You feel it press into your crotch like before.<<masopain 5>><<arousal 1200>>
<br><br>

Winter continues <<his>> speech, talking about the specifics of the horse. And how it was used. <<He>> steps behind you while doing so, and begins to tie your arms. <<He>> works fast, and before long your arms are bound and immobile.
<br><br>

The audience is enraptured by the spectacle. You feel their eyes on your barely-covered <<genitalsstop>> "Of course, humiliation was part of the punishment. They would often have an audience, much like this. And when it was over, the victim would be given to the audience to do with as they please." A <<person3>><<persons>> eyes light up and <<he>> steps forward, but Winter blocks <<his>> path.<<person1>>
