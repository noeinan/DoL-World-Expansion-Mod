<<npc Niki>><<person1>>You approach the address given by Sam. It's an old building opposite the hospital. You're lifting your hand to knock when the door swings open.

A young <<nnpc_gender "Niki">> stands there, a white stick poking out of <<his>> mouth. <<He>> stares at you, waiting.
<br><br>

	<<else>>
	"Sam sent me," you say. "From the Ocean Breeze."
	<</if>>
	<br><br>

	The <<nnpc_gender "Niki">> regards you for a moment longer, then holds out <<his>> hand. "Name's Niki," <<he>> says. "Studio's ready." <<He>> removes the stick from <<his>> mouth and flicks it onto the street.
	<br><br>
<<elseif $niki_seen is "farm">>
	You recognise <<him>>. It's Niki, the photographer from the farm. You freeze on the spot. Niki stares at you, then removes the stick from <<his>> mouth and flicks it onto the street. "Studio's ready." <<He>> pauses. "I'm glad you're okay."
	<br><br>
<<else>>
	You recognise <<him>>. It's Niki, the photographer. Niki nods at you. "Thought the description sounded familiar." <<He>> removes the stick from <<his>> mouth and flicks it onto the street. "Studio's ready."

The interior is more modern. You follow Niki up a flight of stairs, and enter a large room dominated by a white screen. Several lights and a single camera wait.
<br><br>

"You done this before?" Niki asks, fiddling with the camera. <<He>> has another white stick in <<his>> mouth. You shake your head. <<He>> nods without looking at you. "Clothes are over there. Should be done in a few hours."
<br><br>

You walk behind a screen, and find a chef's apron and hat. You put them on.

Poses and the like." <<He>> removes the stick from <<his>> mouth, and replaces it with a lollipop from <<his>> pocket.
<br><br>

<<He>> only talks to give instructions, or advice.

You follow Niki's instructions to the letter.

You take Niki's instructions as a guideline, and do your own thing when the urge strikes you. Niki seems neither impressed nor bothered.
<</if>>

"Props," <<he>> says into <<his>> phone after an hour. "I'll be back shortly," <<he>> says. "The cream is stored separately. Regulations. My people will arrive soon with the rest." <<He>> leaves the room, leaving you stood alone in front of the screen.

<<person1>>The door barges open, and a <<person>> enters, carrying a small oven. <<Hes>> followed by five others, each carrying armfuls of kitchen utensils.
<br><br>
"Make way <<girl>>," the <<person>> says, glancing at you. "We got a kitchen to set up."
<br><br>
You watch as they prepare the props in front of the white screen. You catch them glancing at you when they think you're not looking.

You walk over. The <<person1>><<person>> holds an arm out. "Don't get in the way <<girl>>," <<he>> says.
<br><br>

"But I want to see," you say, ignoring <<him>>. You approach the oven, and bend over to look inside. "I said-" the <<person>> begins, but <<he>> cuts off when you start wiggling your <<bottom>>. The others stop working. You can feel their eyes on you.

You turn to them, and lean back against the oven. "Niki's getting the cream," you say. "But I don't want to wait. How about you lend a hand?"
<br><br>

The <<person>> looks bemused. "We're busy here <<girl>>. We don't have time to go fetch-" You interrupt <<him>> by reaching out, and pressing a finger against <<his>> lips.
<br><br>

"You have all the cream you need right here," you say.

Some seem more eager to be "milked" than others, but they all line up for the service. When finished, you have a decent supply of "cream" in the pot. Enough to fill a ladle at least.
<br><br>

The door opens. Niki's back. The workers hurry to cover up, and pretend to be busy. "W-we're just finishing up," the <<person>> says. Niki doesn't even glance over.

Niki has you pose holding various kitchen utensils. You smile for the camera, posing as instructed. You work for another hour, until Niki gives a satisfied sigh.
<br><br>
"Almost done," <<he>> says. "Just need the money shot. If you'll pardon the expression. You're going to get messy, so I left it for last."

"I already have cream," you say, gesturing at the pot. "The others brought some."

Niki shrugs. "Fine by me." <<He>> walks back to the camera. "I'd like you to get a ladleful, look at the camera, and pour it over your chest. Pull a happy, but sheepish, expression. You're in the middle of a silly accident."
<br><br>
You add some regular cream to the lewd fluid to bulk it out, spoon out a ladle, smile at the camera, and pour it over your chest. Niki snaps more pictures. "Could you play with it a little?" <<he>> asks. You follow <<his>> instructions, getting the "cream" on your hands and face.

You end up on the floor, with the pot on your head, covered head-to-toe in sticky fluid.
