<i>You've been left blindfolded in the middle of a public street! You need help to remove the device blocking your eyes. Someone's sure to notice you unless you hide.
<<if $worn.face.type.includes("gag")>>
With your mouth gagged, you won't be able to scream if accosted. Hopefully the attention you attract is benevolent.
<<else>>
If accosted, screaming for help may attract attention, though not necessarily of a nice sort. Screaming during the night is even more dangerous.
