	<<generatey1>><<person1>>You recognise a <<person>> from your maths class up ahead. <<Hes>> stood among several other students crowded together at the end of an alley across from the school. They're talking to a figure in a heavy coat stood deeper in the shadows.
	<br><br>
	As you watch, a few packages change hands between them. The <<person>> fumbles <<his>> own, spilling a small plastic bag filled with bright coloured pills onto the pavement. A police siren sounds in the distance, and the figure retreats into the shadows. The students walk down the street while the <<person>> picks up <<his>> pills and rushes to catch up.
	<br><br>
	You overhear the other students making fun of <<him>> as they walk past you. "I can't believe you'd never heard of this stuff before."
	<br>
	"Only losers waste time studying the normal way..."
	<br><br>
	This isn't the first time you've seen students doing business with dealers around here. However, it is the first time you've heard of students buying drugs to help with their studies. That might be why the dealers frequent the area.

		An expensive-looking car parks in front of you. Most of the students around you stop to gaze at it in awe. The windows lower and you recognise its driver, it's Avery. "There you are," <<he>> says with a smile. "I was on my way back home from work, so I thought I'd come pick you up."
		<br><br>

		A few students murmur amongst themselves. They're wondering how you could possibly afford such treatment.
