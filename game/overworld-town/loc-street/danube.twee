:: Danube Oak [nobr]

<<set $outside to 1>><<set $location to "town">><<effects>>
You walk behind the spa, and find the oak the note mentioned. It stands at the edge of the forest. This is where you were told to strip. There's no one around.

<<if $phase is 0>>
	You <<nervously>> remove your clothing as the note said, until you're stood naked, here on the outskirts of town.

<<else>>
	You take a deep breath and glance around. This is a lot of money. You <<nervously>> remove your clothing as the note said, until you're stood naked, here on the outskirts of town.
<</if>>
<br><br>
Something flashes in the oak's branches. A camera. <<covered>> You feel your face heat up, but notice something else above you. A small parachute floats down, carrying a little box. You catch it. There's a note inside.
<br><br>
<i>It was nice working with you.</i>
<br><br>
There's £100 behind the paper. You get dressed as fast as your shaking hands will allow. You don't think anyone saw you. Except the camera.
