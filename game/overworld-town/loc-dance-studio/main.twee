A dozen people are already inside. It's easy to pick out the instructor. Hands on hips, <<he>> stands addressing the class, explaining the importance of proper posture when walking.

	The door closes behind you, alerting <<him>> to your presence. <<He>> turns <<his>> emerald eyes to you and smiles. "We have a new student! Welcome."

	Without saying anything, the instructor walks over to you and puts a protective arm around your shoulders. <<He>> whispers, "Don't worry, I don't bite. My name's Charlie. I'll help you out of your shell." <<He>> gently escorts you over to the rest of the class before commencing the lesson.

	The dance room is cluttered with discarded leotards, dance equipment, and floor mats. Charlie greets the class and begins, "For this lesson, I want you to clean the room up without using your hands. Use your heels." You do as <<npc Charlie>><<person1>><<he>> says.

	A line of tape is placed on the dance room floor. You and your classmates take turns doing catwalks down the line, moving elegantly to imitate fashion models. As you walk, Charlie grabs you by the waist and guides each step. "That's it! Keep moving!"

As the class winds down, you and the other students are led to the corner where a television cart sits. Flipping the television on, Charlie instructs the class to watch a short educational video before leaving.

A guide to etiquette appears on the screen. The posh narrator explains how to walk and carry oneself when at a fancy restaurant.
