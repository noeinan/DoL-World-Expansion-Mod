		Laying submissively on your bed, Whitney crawls forward and leans in to steal a kiss, slowly and lovingly making out with you for some time. Gently wrapping <<his>> hands around your leash, <<he>> then pulls out a small heart-shaped padlock from one of <<his>> jacket pockets, and with a click makes sure you won’t be able to remove it on your own.

	From there, <<his>> hand runs up the side of your cheek and begins petting through your hair. Biting down on your lower lip, <<he>> gives it a gentle tug before pulling away.

	A predatory smile is plastered across <<his>> face. “I own you. Remember that,” <<he>> whispers, standing up and tugging the leash taut. “Now come on, it’s time for your walk. If you are a good <<if $player.gender_appearance is "f">>girl<<else>>boy<</if>>, maybe you’ll earn yourself a treat.”

Whitney tugs on your leash and walks proudly out from the bushes outside your bedroom window, marching you onto the sidewalk of Domus Street. It’s late at night, so there aren’t many people around, but you can still sense prying eyes looking out from the glowing windows. Occasional passersby whistle and make some remarks as you walk eastwards. 
<br><br>

“Looking good, bitch! Real cute in your <<underbottoms>>.” 
<br><br>

“You must be real sick to let your <<if $NPCName[$NPCNameList.indexOf("Whitney")].pronoun is "f">>girlfriend<<else>>boyfriend<</if>> walk you around like a pet.” 
<br><br>

“On the end of a leash, that’s where sluts like that belong.” 
<br><br>

After a while, your face is flush pink with humiliation, and head lowered towards the sidewalk. Whitney, too, is tiring of these remarks. Stopping underneath a streetlight,<<he>>turns back towards you and pulls you close. 
<br><br>

<<His>> strong arms wrap around you, and <<he>> holds you tight, one hand firmly on your ass. “Nevermind those assholes. They’re just jealous.” <<He>> whispers into your ear. You feel a warmth grow within you, and butterflies flutter in your stomach. “Keep that chin up, and let’s go. You’re being such a good <<if $player.gender_appearance is "f">>girl<<else>>boy<</if>>.”
<br><br>

You can’t help but smile and nod.

You continue along down the road together, eventually making your way to Connudatus Street. It’s much busier here than outside the orphanage, as late night partiers and tourists make their way up and down the road. 
<br><br>

All heads turn to look, however, when you and Whitney step out into the light. There’s an air of hushed disbelief at the sight of you. Instinctively, you cover your chest and with an arm and hold onto the waistband of your <<underbottoms>>, making sure to avoid a wardrobe malfunction.

Whitney tugs the leash tight, pulling you closer to <<him>> protectively, shooting glares at those who stare too long.

Others around take a step back from the pair of you, and Whitney smiles, realizing that <<he>> now has quite the captivated audience. “But <<pshe>>’s free to look at. Stare all you want, just don’t let me catch you taking photos. Unless you got an extra five pounds in your wallet. C’mon, pet, give the crowd a spin!” <<he>> commands, pulling at your leash right beneath your neck and forcing you to twirl. 
<br><br>

You desperately try to cover yourself, but some people do take the opportunity to take photos. 
<br><br>

“I’m glad you enjoyed the show, but <<pshe>>’s got someplace else to be." Whitney addresses the crowd. "Move, slut. I need to pick up something to drink.” With a sharp tug, <<he>> starts crossing the street, heading to the closest liquor store.

All heads turn to look, however, when you and Whitney step out into the light. It seems like everyone with a phone or a camera is suddenly aiming them in your direction, and it’s overwhelming, causing you to cover up the best you can with your hands.

Despite the humiliation, you obey, lifting your hands and spinning in place. Some people do take the opportunity to take photos, and Whitney gives the audience a big smile for each one, pulling you into various poses in between slapping away groping hands.

“I’m glad you enjoyed the show, but <<pshe>>’s got someplace else to be.” <<he>> announces to the crowd. “Move, slut. I need to pick up something to drink.” With a sharp tug, <<he>> starts crossing the street, heading to the closest liquor store.

You look down and do your best to cover yourself, but feel the ever watching eye of a security camera recording the whole thing.

“Barney! Good to see you, you ugly bastard.” <<He>> taunts the short, balding man. 
<br><br>

“N-not again, Whitney, this is like the third time this week, I-” he stammers, reaching up to his brow with a cloth to wipe up some sweat, while his eyes turn towards you and look you up and down. His breathing begins to quicken. 
<br><br>

“What, no appreciation for your regular customers, now? No wonder your business is failing. Now stop yammering and get me and my <<if $player.gender_appearance is "f">>girl<<else>>boy<</if>> a bottle of your finest whiskey, or I’m taking what little you have in that cash register.” Whitney threatens in confidence. Too nervous to refuse, he hurriedly moves to his display shelf to get a small bottle of liquor. 
<br><br>

“Nothing but the best for my slut.” <<He>> whispers in your ear, nipping at it playfully while you wait. Behind you, other shoppers make taunts, and one even sneaks a feel of your ass while Whitney is distracted. Thankfully, as soon as the shopkeep returns, Whitney snatches the bottle from his hands and releases your shoulder, starting to walk you outside.

“Your Dad can’t keep you out of trouble forever, Whitney!” the balding man shouts as you step back outside onto the street.

Enduring whistling and further taunts from passersby, you walk until the busy street ends, and Whitney leads you down the alley to a gap in a chain link fence, and then through to an old lot with nothing but an old trailer on it.

Despite being out of the way, you’re not entirely alone. Some of Whitney’s friends are here, drinking, smoking, and paying the pair of you little mind. You’re led into the trailer, and Whitney sits you down on the mattress inside. After lighting some candles, and a cigarette, <<he>> just stops to stare at you. It’s almost as if they didn’t expect to get this far, and <<he>>’s got no idea what to do next, looking you up and down.

<<His>> eyes don’t leave you while <<he>> opens the spoils from the liquor store to get a taste, before passing you the bottle. You don’t think it’s a good idea to turn <<him>> down at this point, so you take a shot, shuddering and making a face from the bitter taste. 
<br><br>

“Fuck, you’re beautiful. I mean, you’re really something else, you know that, slut?” <<He>> tells you after some time. “And you’re mine. All mine.”

Something within deep inside you gives you the courage to strip completely nude. Wiggling out of your <<underwearbottoms>>, you find yourself purring.
<br><br>

Once completely nude, you can’t help but stretch yourself out, cutely posing for the <<boy>>.
<br><br>

“That’s right, kitten. Now, crawl over here and let’s get you ready.” Whitney growls, crouching down and beckoning with a single finger as they pull the drawstring bag off  <<his>> shoulder.
<br><br>

You hop off your bed with grace and crawl to Whitney.
<br><br>

“Good kitten.” They whisper, pulling your head back but still maintaining a firm grip.
<br><br>

“Didn’t expect you to be so excited. But what pet doesn’t want to go out to play with their owner? Here, let’s get you ready.”
<br><br>

Whitney reaches deep into the bag and, after some rummaging, they pull out two sets of gear; leather knee pads and mittens shaped like paws.
<br><br>

“I want you crawling the entire time we’re out without bitching about it. But I doubt a pussy like you would get very far on bare concrete. Here, lemme put these on.”
<br><br>

Despite the insults, you know <<he>>'s right about it, and reach out obediently to let <<him>> buckle the protective gear onto you.
<br><br>

Afterwards, you mew cheerily, and then find yourself somewhat in shock at the involuntary noise. Whitney, too, looks a little surprised by your behaviour.
<br><br>

“Well, uh. Let’s get your collar on, too. Then I’ll take you over to the park. Alright, slut?” <<He>> asks, but<<he>>wasn’t waiting for your response.

Once the collar is buckled shut, <<he>> locks it on with a silver heart-shaped padlock, and flicks the bell at the front just to hear the jingle.

 “Adorable little bitch. Don’t you worry your pretty little head while we’re out, okay? I won’t let anyone else hurt you a bit.” <<He>> assures you, before taking you outside.

“Fuck. I had other plans for you tonight, but seeing you like this has got me thinking. You’re a special kind of slut, you know that?”
<br><br>

<<he>> whispers, before tugging the chain tight, pulling you upwards into a begging pose, your ‘paws’ limp in front of you.
<br><br>

Despite the humiliating position and the biting cold night air, you feel a surprising warmth, and smile up at your bully happily. “Come on. I wanna show you off to the whole damn town.”
<br><br>

Crawling out from the bushes, you make your way onto Domus street and onto the sidewalk. The neighbourhood seems different, somehow, than the last time you followed this same route.
<br><br>

Maybe it’s just because you’re so low to the ground, now, but you’re pretty sure you feel the change in the air.

You crawl along behind Whitney but stay close as you can without tripping <<him>> up, and the slack on the chain is tightened to keep you there.

“Cute cat. Hey, what is it with people walking their cats these days? It isn’t something you used to see.” comes a brief comment from a <<npc>> behind you.

Embarrassed, you stay quiet and close to Whitney. “Dunnoh. <<pshe>> seems to be enjoying <<pherself>>.” Whitney replies, hurrying away with you in tow. Soon enough, you arrive at the park.

You crawl onto the park trail from the west side, close to Whitney’s side. “I know a spot nearby. C’mon, pet.” <<he>> says, giving a tug on the leash.
<br><br>

You follow the trail for a while, passing late night joggers and lurking pickpockets, but cut off into the bushes suddenly.
<br><br>

As the light from the main trail lights disappears, your eyes adjust, but Whitney uses an old lighter to find <<his>> way.
<br><br>

Once again, you notice that something isn’t quite the same about the atmosphere. It isn’t just that you’re crawling, the world around you is brighter and more colorful somehow, you’re sure of it.
<br><br>

A particularly pretty patch of tulips distracts you, and you crawl towards it, instinctively taking a curious sniff until you feel the tug of your leash leading you on.
<br><br>

“C’mon, slut. Don’t make me drag you.” Whitney scolds, and you hurriedly return to <<his>> side, bell jingling. “It’s just up ahead now.”

You continue to follow <<him>> down the hidden park trail, stopping occasionally to sniff the flowers or when a bird flutters nearby.
<br><br>

Although all the pausing was annoying <<him>> at first, Whitney’s grown used to it and waits on you while you play.
<br><br>

Eventually you come to a small fire pit, with camping chairs and large logs surrounding it, probably set up by Whitney and <<his>> friends.
<br><br>

<<He>> leads you over to the largest chair and sits down, facing you and patting <<his>> lap. “Hop up, kitten.” <<he>> commands, not looking at you but rather typing out a message on  <<his>>  phone.
<br><br>

Still, you obediently crawl up into <<his>> lap and curl up, getting comfy. “My friends will be here soon. But for now, you can just relax right here, slut.”
<br><br>

Whitney puts away <<his>> phone eventually, and <<his>> hands promptly begin exploring your naked body.
<br><br>

Fingers stroke up and down your thighs and through your hair, even scritching behind your fuzzy ears. When <<his>> friends arrive a few minutes later, they see you curled up in Whitney’s lap with a look of bliss on your face, purring away.

You lose track of time. Around you, people are talking and laughing, but for some reason you can’t fully understand what they’re saying.
<br><br>

Whitney pulls <<his>> hands away from you eventually, and you mew in frustration. Everyone seems to laugh at that, but you aren’t sure why.
<br><br>

Another hand soon replaces it, as one of the other people reaches down to pet you. Soon, you’re surrounded by Whitney’s friends, being poked, prodded, and teased.
<br><br>

“Alright, that’s enough. Sit down so I can put the slut to work.” Whitney eventually orders, the voice cutting through a fog in your mind.
<br><br>

<<He>> leans in, nipping at your ear, and growls into it. “C’mon, pet. Enough relaxing, now. Put that body of yours to work.”
<br><br>

Despite the audience, you eagerly wiggle about in <<his>> lap, getting into a more suitable position.

Now that your owner is satisfied, and the sun is starting to creep over the edge of the horizon, it’s time to head home.
<br><br>

Whitney says goodbye to <<his>> friends, and then leads you down the trail, through the park, and back through town to the orphanage.
<br><br>

You crawl the entire way, and it feels quite natural. But once you get back to the bushes outside your bedroom window, there’s a sudden shift of perspective.
<br><br>

The entire evening replays in your head, and you’re aware of the bizarre behaviour.
<br><br>

“Well, that wasn’t what I expected, but it was fun, pet. What the hell came over you?” Whitney asks, looking down at you.
<br><br>

Blushing, you finally stand up, and struggle for an answer. “I don’t even know.” you reply eventually.
<br><br>

Whitney quickly releases you from the collar and mitts, and puts everything back into <<his>> bag. “You’re a special kind of slut. Real weird. I like that, though.” <<he>> praises.
<br><br>

“That was, uh, a lot of fun, pet. I know it must’ve been a surprise, but I hope you enjoyed yourself, too. You were such a good <<if $player.gender_appearance is "f">>girl<<else>>boy<</if>>. Here. Your reward, as promised.”

	<<He>> shrugs the drawstring bag off <<his>> shoulder, reaches inside, and pulls out an old brown teddy bear. It’s in rough shape, patches missing from its fur, a cigarette burn on its paw, and an eye hanging down by a thread. 
	<br><br>

	“Just something to remember this date by. Used to be mine, when I was little. Figured you’d be into that type of thing.” <<he>> says with a surprisingly soft smile. “Now get some sleep, and I’ll see you at school… slut.” 
	<br><br>

	Instead of a goodnight kiss, <<he>> shocks you with a sharp slap to your ass, laughing mischievously as <<he>> turns to leave.

Something within deep inside you gives you the courage to strip completely nude. Wiggling out of your <<underwearbottoms>>, your tail wags happily behind you.
<br><br>

Once completely nude, you sit pretty, cutely posing for the <<boy>> you consider to be your owner. “That’s right, pup. Now, crawl over here and let’s get you ready.”
<br><br>

Whitney growls, crouching down and beckoning with a single finger as they pull the drawstring bag off <<his>> shoulder. You hop off your bed and drop to the floor on all fours, hastily crawling to Whitney.
<br><br>

<<He>> reaches out and pets through your hair for a while, before taking a tight grip and pulling your head back. <<He>> leans in and presses <<his>> lips against yours, holding you there while <<he>> makes out with you.
<br><br>

“Good bitch.” They whisper, pulling your head back but still maintaining a firm grip. “Didn’t expect you to be so excited. But what pet doesn’t want to go out to play with their owner? Here, let’s get you ready.”
<br><br>

Whitney reaches deep into the bag and, after some rummaging, they pull out two sets of gear; leather knee pads and mittens shaped like paws.
<br><br>

“I want you crawling the entire time we’re out, understand. But I doubt a weak little bitch like you would get very far on bare concrete. Here, lemme put these on.”
<br><br>

Despite the insults, you know <<he>>'s right about it, and reach out obediently to let <<him>> buckle the protective gear onto you. Afterwards, you let out a happy bark, and then find yourself somewhat in shock at the involuntary noise.
<br><br>

Whitney, too, looks a little surprised by your behaviour. “Well, uh. Let’s get your collar on, too. Then I’ll take you over to the beach. Alright, slut?” <<He>> asks, but<<he>>wasn’t waiting for your response.
<br><br>

While <<he>>'s unclipping the collar from <<his>> belt, you sit down and straighten your posture, posing so that <<he>> can easily reach around and wrap the thick leather around your neck.
<br><br>

Once it is buckled shut, <<he>> locks it on with a silver heart-shaped padlock. “Adorable little bitch. Don’t you worry your pretty little head while we’re out, okay? I won’t let anyone else hurt you a bit.” <<He>> assures you, petting through your hair.

You’re set down on all fours right outside your bedroom window, and for a while Whitney just stares down at you with hunger in <<his>> eyes.
<br><br>

“Fuck. I had other plans for you tonight, but seeing you like this has got me thinking. You’re a special kind of slut, you know that?” <<he>> whispers, before tugging the chain tight.
<br><br>

You sit down on all fours at <<his>> feet, tail dragging back and forth through the dirt behind you.
<br><br>

Despite the humiliating position and the biting cold night air, you feel a surprising warmth, and smile up at your bully happily. “Come on. I wanna show you off to the whole damn town.”
<br><br>

Crawling out from the bushes, you make your way onto Domus street and onto the sidewalk. The neighbourhood seems different, somehow, than the last time you followed this same route.
<br><br>

Maybe it’s just because you’re so low to the ground, now, but you’re pretty sure you feel the change in the air. You crawl along behind Whitney but stay close as you can without tripping <<him>> up, and the slack on the chain is tightened to keep you there.
<br><br>

“Cute dog. You two headed to the beach?” comes a brief comment from a <<npc>> behind you. Embarrassed, you stay quiet and close to Whitney.
<br><br>

At first, Whitney has no idea how to respond. “Yeah, actually.” they eventually say, hurrying away with you in tow. Soon enough, you arrive at the beach.

You crawl your way onto the sands at Whitney’s side, crawling towards a large piece of driftwood a distance away from the ocean. Both of you look around the spot, seeing late night joggers and other people walking their own pets.
<br><br>

Once again, you notice that something isn’t quite the same about the atmosphere. It isn’t just that you’re crawling, the world around you is brighter and more colorful somehow, you’re sure of it.
<br><br>

Eager to get to go out and play, you tire of being on a leash. Eventually you’re out in front of Whitney, feeling a firm tug at the chain. “Heel, bitch.” <<he>> commands, and reluctantly you return to <<his>> side to continue crawling along.
<br><br>

Not long after, you get to the driftwood, and Whitney sits down. “This isn’t what I expected from tonight, but I like surprises. Wonder what other tricks you know. Wanna play fetch?” they ask.

Your eyes light up at Whitney’s suggestion, and you nod excitedly, tail wagging around behind you. “Alright, I’ll let you off your chain. Be good, and no crawling off, alright?” <<He>> chuckles, reaching down to unclip you, and then picks up a small stick out from the sand.
<br><br>

Your eyes focus on the stick as it’s dangled in the air in front of you, and you ready yourself for the throw. Whitney pulls back and gives it a good toss, and you quickly find yourself giving chase, rushing through the sand as fast as you can go on all fours.
<br><br>

As you run, it feels like a heavy fog is settling into your head, clouding your thoughts and making it difficult to think. But you keep going.
<br><br>

By the time you reach the stick, you’ve already forgotten the feeling, and lean down to pick it up from the sand in your mouth, before turning to crawl back to Whitney proudly.
<br><br>

“Good little bitch. It’s funny seeing that bare ass wiggle as you crawl about.” Your owner teases you, but the only word you really hear is ‘Good.’
<br><br>

The stick is thrown across the sand for you a few more times, and each time you bring it back, the less familiar the world around you feels.
<br><br>

Once you get tired, you lay down in the sand by your owner’s feet, and they lean down to reattach your leash. “My friends are here, pup. You be good, now.” <<he>> commands, and you look the way you came to see a small crowd approaching. Friends! You bark in their direction excitedly.

Whitney and <<his>> friends are talking, laughing, and joking around a campfire, but you’re definitely the center of attention. Various hands pet through your hair and scratch behind your ears, keeping that tail of yours wagging excitedly.

They even give you belly rubs! It’s while you’re in that position, on your back at everyone’s feet, that Whitney decides to tell <<his>> friends to move aside.
<br><br>

“Alright, enough of that. I think my puppy here has one more trick to show off.” <<He>> growls, and the others return to their seats.
<br><br>

Whitney climbs on top of you there on a soft, grassy patch. <<He>> leans close, holding you by the hair, and <<he>> whispers softly into your ear. 
<br><br>

“C’mon, pet. Enough play time. Put that body of yours to work.” Despite the audience, you eagerly nod your head, wiggling about to get comfortable.
