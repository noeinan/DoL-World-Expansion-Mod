You come to a dead end, your path blocked by a brick wall. You hear voices coming from the way you arrived. If you go back that way, you fear your <<lewdness>> will be seen. You notice a small hole at the base of the wall, maybe large enough for you to squeeze through. You could also wait until the threat has passed.<br><br>

You are walking down an alley when you hear people up ahead. You turn back the way you came, but hear people coming from that direction as well. You look around for a way to keep your <<lewdness>> concealed, but there's nothing here except some mannequins lined up against a wall.<br><br>

The voices get quieter and you are about to move when the dumpster yawns open! Before you can react, a pair of arms emerge and drag you inside.<br><br>

<<beastgenderpassage>>You continue on, your heart pounding in your chest. You hear voices up ahead, so you move into a blind alley and duck behind a dumpster. The voices get louder, it sounds like a pair of teenagers. They stop at the end of the alley, trapping you. As you look around for an escape route you notice a stray dog looking at your from under a discarded newspaper.<br><br>


It walks over to you, tail wagging, and begins barking. You hope it doesn't attract attention to you.<br><br><<set $timer to 10>>
