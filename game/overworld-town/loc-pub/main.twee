You enter the pub. The interior has a cosy, rustic look. Old farm tools decorate the walls, a nod to the long-standing agricultural businesses nearby.
<<if $daystate is "night">>
	Despite the hour, the place teems with activity. Getting a table must be difficult.

	"I've not seen you around," says a man's voice beside you. <<He>> has short black hair, a grey sweater and dark trousers. Not someone you'd normally look twice at, least of all in a place like this. "Would you like to join me? I have a proposition for you."

<</if>>
Deciding there's no chance of danger in public like this, you agree. <<He>> leads you to a small area adjacent to the main room, partially shielded from view. Oddly the tables here are empty. <<He>> sits at a small table, and you follow suit. You realise <<he>> has a slender build, concealed by <<his>> somewhat plain and baggy clothing.
<br><br>
"I'll be frank," <<he>> says. "I know you need money. Don't ask me how I know, word gets around. I think I can help you. If you come across any jewellery or other items you don't know what to do with, I can take them off your hands. I'll pay well."
<br><br>
<<He>> looks over your shoulder, as if making sure you're still alone. "As well as can be expected, anyway. We might also be able to help each other out from time to time. That's all I had to say." <<He>> stands up and puts out <<his>> hand. "Keep me in mind at least. Ask one of the staff when you want to speak with me, they'll know where to find me. My name's Landry."

	<br><br>
	"Get it for me and I'll prevent any of your past misdemeanours being pinned on you. It's a small black box. You shouldn't get it confused with any rocks or twigs. Oh, and do be careful. People disappear in there all the time."

	"Hacking a police computer?!" Landry nods, reclining. "I like your style. But if you're looking for my help you're out of luck.
	Never been into all that cyber stuff."
	<br><br>
	Landry sits forward, rubs <<his>> chin thoughtfully. "Times change though. And they all keep telling me that's where the money is nowadays. Tell you what -
	they say there's this kid in town, <span class="teal">some orphan kid at the home on Domus.</span> Some kind of computers whiz. Makes stuff, breaks stuff.
	I think the kid's called Mickey or McKay or something like that."
	<br><br>
	You think of the other orphans. One face leaps to mind.
	<br>
	"Whatever," Landry sits back. "Best hope is to go to the orphanage on Domus and find this kid. Just watch out. Person who runs the place is called Bailey.
	Nasty piece of work. Makes Briar look like a bleeding-heart humanitarian. You know Briar? Well anyway, Bailey's protective. If you get caught, you're on your own.

	Said you'd have a bunch of Esty cards for me to take?"
	<br>
	You hand over the SD memory cards. In return Landry gives you an envelope. Inside is money and a card with a word scrawled on it.
	<br><br>
	"Thanks. And that there's the police master password along with a £500 thank you for bringing in some talent. I may have new kinds of work in the future.
	There's also this."
	<br>
	Landry hands you a USB stick.
	<br><br>

	"Some kind of virus. Spreads over an eye-pee network? Wipes every computer clean. To quote our mutual friend: 'it will most certainly ruin someone's day.'
	Should be able to cause some trouble with that one. Or make old trouble disappear. Right? Maybe next thing I'll be asking you to clear up my past misdeeds.
