You enter the pub. The interior has a cosy, rustic look. Old farm tools decorate the walls, a nod to the long-standing agricultural businesses nearby.
<<if $daystate is "night">>
	Despite the hour, the place teems with activity. Getting a table must be difficult.

	"I've not seen you around," says a man's voice beside you. <<He>> has short black hair, a grey sweater and dark trousers. Not someone you'd normally look twice at, least of all in a place like this. "Would you like to join me? I have a proposition for you."

	"I've not seen you around," says a woman's voice beside you. <<He>> has shoulder-length black hair, a grey cardigan and dark trousers. Not someone you'd normally look twice at, least of all in a place like this. "Would you like to join me? I have a proposition for you."
	<br><br>
<</if>>
Deciding there's no chance of danger in public like this, you agree. <<He>> leads you to a small area adjacent to the main room, partially shielded from view. Oddly the tables here are empty. <<He>> sits at a small table, and you follow suit. You realise <<he>> has a slender build, concealed by <<his>> somewhat plain and baggy clothing.
<br><br>
"I'll be frank," <<he>> says. "I know you need money. Don't ask me how I know, word gets around. I think I can help you. If you come across any jewellery or other items you don't know what to do with, I can take them off your hands. I'll pay well."
<br><br>
<<He>> looks over your shoulder, as if making sure you're still alone. "As well as can be expected, anyway. We might also be able to help each other out from time to time. That's all I had to say." <<He>> stands up and puts out <<his>> hand. "Keep me in mind at least. Ask one of the staff when you want to speak with me, they'll know where to find me. My name's Landry."

"There is someone. <span class="teal">This orphan at the home on Domus Street.</span> A computer whiz. Mickey, or Mckay, something like that."
	<br><br>
	You know who Landry's referring to, but you've never spoken. They keep to themselves.
	<br><br>
	"Best hope," Landry continues. "Is to find this orphan. If you can get them to come work with me, there'll be some money in it for you. Just don't step on Bailey's toes." <<He>> smiles. "But you knew that."
