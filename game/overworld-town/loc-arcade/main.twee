You didn't even know this cabinet existed. It doesn't particularly stand out from the rest of the cabinets in the arcade. Someone else wouldn't have given this a second glance.
<br><br>

A jet-black tint covers the cabinet. You can tell the cabinet isn't new, but it seems oddly pristine as well. Almost as if it was just put into place a week ago. Now that it's piqued your interest, you can't help but feel drawn to it.

	With a coin in your hand, you look for a slot, but you can't seem to find one.
	<br><br>

	The screen suddenly flashes to life, almost blinding you with its incandescent glow. In the center of the screen, you see the word <span class = "purple">"Tenyclus"</span> bolded with a unique font. A copyright in smaller text is seen below.
	<br><br>

	<span class = "purple">"1982, Lüsterngrad"</span>

	Three words light up shortly after. <i>"Press to Start"</i>

	You start to play the game. It's pretty fun for the most part, if not a bit basic. You wonder why you haven't seen anyone else play on this cabinet.
	<br><br>

	The graphics are so primitive, you're not really sure who or what you're playing as. All you can make out is that it looks like you're fighting off something. Your best guess is aliens, but it could really be anything.
