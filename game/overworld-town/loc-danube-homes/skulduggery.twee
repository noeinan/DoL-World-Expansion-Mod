You swim to the bottom of the fountain. As you approach the drain the pull becomes stronger, until you're being pulled along. You're sucked down into the dark and through a passage, before emerging in stale air somewhere underground.

	Uncertain, but fearing that the <<person>> may have been kidnapped or abused, you approach and gently extract the gag. <<He>> retches and coughs.

	<br>
	"No!" <<He>> tries to scream, but you manage to shove the 'gag' back into place. There is a clip to lock it in. Leaving <<him>> chained to the bed and quiet works nicely for your skulduggerous intents.

<<elseif $phase is 1>>
	This looks like S&M play. <<His>> partner ties <<him>> up and abandons <<him>> for an hour or so in this humiliating state. Why interrupt their play? In any case, having <<him>> conveniently locked in place and quiet works nicely for your skulduggerous needs.

	"Stop looking at me! Get out of my house?! Are you..? Just fuck off! Right now!"

	Looking at the open cupboard, you see whips and sex toys. Pictures of people tied up and spanked. You'd heard people do this kind of thing, but are shocked to come face to face with it.
